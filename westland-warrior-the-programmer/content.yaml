    The reason I mention JavaScript is because it is the most widely used
    programming language on github. [Searching for projects with more than
    10,000 stars][1] shows 409 JavaScript based projects, the next one down is
    Python with 117.

    A bright new JavaScript compiler/framework named [Svelte][1] (28.2k github
    stars) has recently entered the battle area.

    Previously [Vue.js][2] (154k stars) outcompeted Facebook's [React][3] (141k
    stars).

    Svelte injects its code into your programs, whereas Vue.js and React ask
    you to program their way, learning new functions and strategies.

    Svelte offers a [framework for building web applications][4], and an
    [approach to building mobile apps][5] as well.

    If you are going to start programming, start with [Svelte][6].

    They offer a fantastic live coding tutorial at
