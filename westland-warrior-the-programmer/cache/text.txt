JavaScript

The reason I mention JavaScript is because it is the most widely used
programming language on github. Searching for projects with more than
10,000 stars shows 409 JavaScript based projects, the next one down is

Svelte

A bright new JavaScript compiler/framework named Svelte (28.2k github
stars) has recently entered the battle area.
Previously Vue.js (154k stars) outcompeted Facebook's React (141k
stars).
Svelte injects its code into your programs, whereas Vue.js and React ask
you to program their way, learning new functions and strategies.
Svelte offers a framework for building web applications, and an
approach to building mobile apps as well.

If you are going to start programming, start with Svelte.
They offer a fantastic live coding tutorial at
