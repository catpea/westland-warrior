JAVASCRIPT

The reason I mention JavaScript is because it is the most widely used
programming language on github. Searching for projects with more than10,000 stars[15] shows 409 JavaScript based projects, the next one down is
Python with 117.
Svelte Tutorial[16]

SVELTE

A bright new JavaScript compiler/framework named Svelte[17] (28.2k github
stars) has recently entered the battle area.
Previously Vue.js[18] (154k stars) outcompeted Facebook's React[19] (141k
stars).
Svelte injects its code into your programs, whereas Vue.js and React ask
you to program their way, learning new functions and strategies.
Svelte offers a framework for building web applications[20], and an
approach to building mobile apps[21] as well.
If you are going to start programming, start with Svelte[22].
They offer a fantastic live coding tutorial at

Arduino vs. Raspberry Pi - Which is best?[24]
You can learn Arduino in 15 minutes.[25]
