That will only force them into\naccepting their poverty as a given, and your mediocrity as a fact.\nEducation is never! for good grades, or a good resume, or a good job that\npays well.\nEducation is for the opposite of Memorization and Servitude.\nEducation is for Creativity, and Freedom.\nEducation is for Originality, and Independence.\nEducation is for Unbrekability, and Leadership.\nThe children you taught to wait for Superman, are, that promise, and the\nfuture, and more.\nAnd the opposite of high achievement is not failing while daring greatly.\nFailure is nonsense, just another excuse not to try. There is no such thing\nas failure. Every step forward adds to success.\nGreta Thunberg[17]\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GNInLhL2zA\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjxhenAHyGk\n[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg_Q7KYWG1g\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFMz8JRg8Y8\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtQQC23eseU\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY6VntTmtIo\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnSvy3nH7l0\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlY0PkWxCW8\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFr0FKnaLDk\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_E12FFLw\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rmSldhnSDc\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFnMTHhKdkw\n[14]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk\n[15]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpaFX6Ei0nU\n[16]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\n[17]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrtLsQbaok",
