  <div class="paragraph">"It is hard to teach kids who stink."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must face the misjudgment of the role of poverty in education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must face the misjudgment of the the gravity of poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must face policy that does not make sense, that will never make sense,
    due to persistent malformed-understanding of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education begins in kindergarten, it is easy to forget this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It begins with mentors, inspiration, friendship.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no education without human connection, but there is merit in apps,
    computer programs, videos, audio books, and overhead internet satellites.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We need a clear aim, for both, educators, and the kids. There is no clearer
    aim than becoming a Business Creator, and escaping poverty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rising to no end in sight. Eventually leaving a worthy legacy. Unbreakable
    shoulders for other giants to stand on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cure for poverty bears the same pattern as the cure for broken
    education. The individual must become a businessperson, just as the student
    must become her own teacher.</div>

    <h2>Limitless</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to forget that we have no limits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to believe the lie, that we can stop because we are not learning
    fast enough, or we know enough, or got enough; or had enough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to misunderstand the purpose of Education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We don't need a generation of Brilliant and Unstoppable Teachers, or Policy
    Makers. Oh, there will never be enough of those; and there is already far
    too many.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending to be wise and authentic is far too easy, to put the future of
    humanity in someone else's hands.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even if it wasn't a fantasy aimed to place responsibility for education
    elsewhere, there is no good reason to wait for Policy Makers to update
    policy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We must teach children that they are responsible for their own education,
    and their own exit from poverty, by means of becoming a business creator.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Children need an aim, before they open the textbook.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They need persistent enlightenment. Not moronic excuses that they won't
    always have a calculator at hand, or sick fantasies of a happy job they
    will always love performing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We don't need better teachers, we need and endless supply of Brilliant and
    Unstoppable Students who accept the responsibility for their own education,
    at their own pace, and a sequence that matches who they are.</div>

    <h2>Each a Superhero</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">Grades must end, because too many children confuse their grade point
    average with their value to the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only reason why someone would ever fail a test, is because the wisdom
    they already had, was incompatible with what was being taught.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To force incompatible knowledge on someone, and blame them for not
    integrating it, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you are young and still in school. Begin making unbreakable promises
    that you will fix what is broken. Help your friends to Audio Books that set
    them free to understand Science, or travel the Appalachian Trail when
    waiting for the bus. Help them understand YCombinator and Techstars,
    Startup Accelerators, Angel Funds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And if you have already left it all behind, now it is time to remember your
    hopes and dreams. Go back with your wisdom of today, and fix what was
    broken when you were little. Stand up in the classroom and rage against
    mediocrity or lies. Take a lesson from Erica Goldson.</div>

    <h2>Mothers. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">"Education is not the filling of a vessel, but the kindling of a flame."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cradle of education is within. The flame of curiosity, lives within.
    Students reach out and put things into their soul, all the time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes all it takes is a poem.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes the explanation, that all education is really for, is beating
    back Poverty of Mind-and-Wallet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty that they were unfortunately and unfairly dropped into, and now
    they must learn wisdom and fight their way out of, and if they so choose,
    bring back the light so that others may follow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And later, finally, enjoy their existence and high achievement, leave a
    legacy worthy of following.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Never tell a child that life is not fair. That will only force them into
    accepting their poverty as a given, and your mediocrity as a fact.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education is never! for good grades, or a good resume, or a good job that
    pays well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education is for the opposite of Memorization and Servitude.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education is for Creativity, and Freedom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education is for Originality, and Independence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education is for Unbrekability, and Leadership.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The children you taught to wait for Superman, are, that promise, and the
    future, and more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the opposite of high achievement is not failing while daring greatly.
    Failure is nonsense, just another excuse not to try. There is no such thing
    as failure. Every step forward adds to success.</div>
