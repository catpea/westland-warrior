      <p>&quot;It is hard to teach kids who stink.&quot;</p>
      <p>We must face the misjudgment of the role of poverty in education.</p>
      <p>We must face the misjudgment of the the gravity of poverty.</p>
      <p>We must face policy that does not make sense, that will never make sense,<br>due to persistent malformed-understanding of education.</p>
      <p>Education begins in kindergarten, it is easy to forget this.</p>
      <p>It begins with mentors, inspiration, friendship.</p>
      <p>There is no education without human connection, but there is merit in apps,<br>computer programs, videos, audio books, and overhead internet satellites.</p>
      <p>We need a clear aim, for both, educators, and the kids. There is no clearer<br>aim than becoming a Business Creator, and escaping poverty.</p>
      <p>Rising to no end in sight. Eventually leaving a worthy legacy. Unbreakable<br>shoulders for other giants to stand on.</p>
      <p>The cure for poverty bears the same pattern as the cure for broken<br>education. The individual must become a businessperson, just as the student<br>must become her own teacher.</p>

      <p>It is easy to forget that we have no limits.</p>
      <p>It is easy to believe the lie, that we can stop because we are not learning<br>fast enough, or we know enough, or got enough; or had enough.</p>
      <p>It is easy to misunderstand the purpose of Education.</p>
      <p>We don&#39;t need a generation of Brilliant and Unstoppable Teachers, or Policy<br>Makers. Oh, there will never be enough of those; and there is already far<br>too many.</p>
      <p>Pretending to be wise and authentic is far too easy, to put the future of<br>humanity in someone else&#39;s hands.</p>
      <p>Even if it wasn&#39;t a fantasy aimed to place responsibility for education<br>elsewhere, there is no good reason to wait for Policy Makers to update<br>policy.</p>
      <p>We must teach children that they are responsible for their own education,<br>and their own exit from poverty, by means of becoming a business creator.</p>
      <p>Children need an aim, before they open the textbook.</p>
      <p>They need persistent enlightenment. Not moronic excuses that they won&#39;t<br>always have a calculator at hand, or sick fantasies of a happy job they<br>will always love performing.</p>
      <p>We don&#39;t need better teachers, we need and endless supply of Brilliant and<br>Unstoppable Students who accept the responsibility for their own education,<br>at their own pace, and a sequence that matches who they are.</p>

      <p>Grades must end, because too many children confuse their grade point<br>average with their value to the world.</p>
      <p>The only reason why someone would ever fail a test, is because the wisdom<br>they already had, was incompatible with what was being taught.</p>
      <p>To force incompatible knowledge on someone, and blame them for not<br>integrating it, is evil.</p>
      <p>If you are young and still in school. Begin making unbreakable promises<br>that you will fix what is broken. Help your friends to Audio Books that set<br>them free to understand Science, or travel the Appalachian Trail when<br>waiting for the bus. Help them understand YCombinator and Techstars,<br>Startup Accelerators, Angel Funds.</p>
      <p>And if you have already left it all behind, now it is time to remember your<br>hopes and dreams. Go back with your wisdom of today, and fix what was<br>broken when you were little. Stand up in the classroom and rage against<br>mediocrity or lies. Take a lesson from Erica Goldson.</p>

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>&quot;Education is not the filling of a vessel, but the kindling of a flame.&quot;</p>
      <p>The cradle of education is within. The flame of curiosity, lives within.<br>Students reach out and put things into their soul, all the time.</p>
      <p>Sometimes all it takes is a poem.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the explanation, that all education is really for, is beating<br>back Poverty of Mind-and-Wallet.</p>
      <p>Poverty that they were unfortunately and unfairly dropped into, and now<br>they must learn wisdom and fight their way out of, and if they so choose,<br>bring back the light so that others may follow.</p>
      <p>And later, finally, enjoy their existence and high achievement, leave a<br>legacy worthy of following.</p>
      <p>Never tell a child that life is not fair. That will only force them into<br>accepting their poverty as a given, and your mediocrity as a fact.</p>
      <p>Education is never! for good grades, or a good resume, or a good job that<br>pays well.</p>
      <p>Education is for the opposite of Memorization and Servitude.</p>
      <p>Education is for Creativity, and Freedom.</p>
      <p>Education is for Originality, and Independence.</p>
      <p>Education is for Unbrekability, and Leadership.</p>
      <p>The children you taught to wait for Superman, are, that promise, and the<br>future, and more.</p>
      <p>And the opposite of high achievement is not failing while daring greatly.<br>Failure is nonsense, just another excuse not to try. There is no such thing<br>as failure. Every step forward adds to success.</p>
