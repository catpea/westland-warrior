      <p>We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to<br>betray a student for a paycheck.</p>
      <p>Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired. Many felt<br>bad about the level of education we were receiving.</p>
      <p>But, whether they liked it or not, consciously or subconsciously, at the<br>end of the day, it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize<br>for long enough to pass standardized testing, and the administration didn&#39;t<br>have a problem with that.</p>

      <p>The complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward, how<br>fantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary<br>cross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean<br>towards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career.</p>
      <p>Now, pushing her away from what moves her, grading her down for it, and<br>forcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass<br>the grade. That is something else... And the answer to how many children<br>were hurt this way, is: <strong>all of them</strong>, in every school, on every<br>continent, in every country, state and district.</p>
      <p>Schools interrupt education.</p>
      <p>They destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius. They do<br>it just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it.</p>
      <p>They destroy The Shy, The Delicate, The Compassionate.</p>

      <p>Someone said that the only reason the teachers seemed to know more than we<br>did, was because they had to regurgitate that same stuff every year to keep<br>their jobs...</p>
      <p>Each time it came up; there was always someone to say that they wanted to<br>help us, but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and<br>destroy, embrace and extinguish. Get the gifted ones out of the system to<br>make things easier for themselves, to calm the waters - if nothing sticks<br>out, it must be all good.</p>
      <p>Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to cram<br>before a test, pass it, and forget it. Since tests did not represent<br>student knowledge, grades did not represent the student. Everyone knew<br>this, nobody said anything because once the students realized the school<br>was mostly a charade they just wanted to graduate and move on.</p>
      <p>Overwhelming majority of Teachers didn&#39;t want to change anything because<br>they didn&#39;t want to make their job any harder, they just want to get paid<br>and go home. Statistically half of them quit anyway.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">We Set Ourselves Free, to Live Authentic, to Invent, to Triumph.</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>We accepted the responsibility for our own education.</p>
      <p>We begun learning on our own, through internet, Audio Books, trial and<br>error.</p>
      <p>We begun building more and more small companies, and the more we failed the<br>wiser we became.</p>
      <p>The moment schools begun interfering with our companies, with making money<br>that we used to support ourselves, we became dropouts.</p>
      <p>But we did look back, we aimed to fix Education. To make all those<br>countless forgotten aches and pains count.</p>

      <p>At first, nobody wanted to talk to us.</p>
      <p>There was a problem with how Investors viewed people who paraded their GPA<br>or even completed schools.</p>
      <p>The Investors didn&#39;t want followers, and above all they didn&#39;t want<br>cheaters that tried to pass their GPA as something authentic or even<br>meaningful.</p>
      <p>The Investors sought Natural Born Leaders, they sought Evidence of<br>Exceptional Ability.</p>
      <p>The Investors sought people who rejected the inauthenticity of broken<br>education and didn&#39;t partake in stupid charades.</p>
      <p>It was almost like High School became a mechanism to keep the<br>administration busy, the teachers blind, the students poor, and the parents<br>dreaming.</p>

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Staying in school had a negative impact on our education, on our futures.<br>College and Premed brought sleep deprivation into the farce, it was a<br>dangerous joke.</p>
      <p>In the end all we had was our friendship. The school was tearing us apart,<br>the Start-ups kept us together.</p>
      <p>Looking back at how young we were, how unbreakable, how fierce.</p>
      <p>Though we didn&#39;t believe in schools, we doubted ourselves for years. Now,<br>looking back, we searched for mentors, but none were to be found. But, in<br>the absence of teachers, we became the teachers.</p>
      <p>To quote an old commercial: We were The Crazy Ones, The Misfits, The<br>Rebels, The Troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who<br>saw things differently, who were not fond of rules, and had no respect for<br>the status quo.</p>
      <p>We were the ones crazy enough to think we could change the world...</p>
      <p>... and we did ...</p>
