    <h2>Notes from an Imaginary High School: A Quick Reminder</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to<br>betray a student for a paycheck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired. Many felt<br>bad about the level of education we were receiving.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, whether they liked it or not, consciously or subconsciously, at the<br>end of the day, it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize<br>for long enough to pass standardized testing, and the administration didn't<br>have a problem with that.</div>

    <h2>Paved with Good Intentions</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">They meant no harm, they did it so that they could get paid, so that the<br>school could get funding, so that everyone would keep their job. But those<br>who didn't rise against it caused harm. They interfered with our real<br>education, harming creativity, erasing individuality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at home,<br>that bullies were a fact, and life is never fair. They hurt our hearts, and<br>shamed us by saying. "Oh, just grow up, already! Because, you need to<br>improve your grades."</div>

    <h2>We Were Mislead</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">"Today, we'll get it all working, and today we'll get paid. Tomorrow,<br>tomorrow, when everything is worked-out and working, we'll get to the<br>students - one thing at a time." - They'd say.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we knew that tomorrow never comes, once the new day starts, it is<br>already today. The tomorrow they thought of, was more of a garbage can for<br>nice-to-haves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They were working very hard, and it was all very hard work. But they didn't<br>have the strength to do both, their job, and make schools work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In effect, everyone forgot about us. They forgot we were the point and the<br>future. Their aim was no longer our education, but merely staying in<br>business by arranging for what in effect became, an impression of one.</div>

    <h2>Twists & Turns</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">To accomplish all this, some changes needed to be made, they first<br>convinced themselves that they were doing a great job so as long as they<br>were working hard, and then some things needed to be taken away, and a few<br>needed to be twisted around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard, that<br>the administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely<br>stressful. People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To question administration or teachers while they work that hard, makes for<br>a heartless, cruel, shameful petty little student.</div>

    <h2>How Unfortunate... </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">"Focus on the positive, on how hard we work and how far we've come<br>together." - They'd say, ever so lovingly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Void of context, many of the shallow arguments the teachers made could<br>almost stand up to a proper debate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we remained unconvinced because teaching is not just a job. It is not<br>an ordinary job, and it is not just about knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

    <h2>Teaching is Complex</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Teaching requires that the Teacher first comprehends each of the Students,<br>understands their existing body of knowledge, manner of learning, and finds<br>a way to genuinely communicate with them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tracking is not that hard, a pencil or a Concept Mapping tool will do.</div>

    <h2>Teaching is Complex and Rewarding</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Teaching should respectfully extend their existing knowledge. The teacher<br>must know if fascination with Dinosaurs will head towards Paleontology,<br>Biology, Ecology, and keep an eye on progression of that path (if said path<br>continues) to see is they have a Cell Bilogist, Astrobiologist,<br>Evolutionary Biologist, or maybe a Writer, in their class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward, how<br>fantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary<br>cross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean<br>towards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, pushing her away from what moves her, grading her down for it, and<br>forcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass<br>the grade. That is something else... And the answer to how many children<br>were hurt this way, is: <strong>all of them</strong>, in every school, on every<br>continent, in every country, state and district.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools interrupt education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius. They do<br>it just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They destroy The Shy, The Delicate, The Compassionate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They destroy Pacifists, Leaders, Scientists, Inventors, Dreamers, Poets,<br>Artists, Sculptors, Musicians, Adventures, Writers, Makers, Heroes.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">But she left, she's gone. They gave her a 2.0 for Leadership,<br>Unbreakability, Heroism, for spending her last semester reading books she<br>loved, at the school library she loved, right before getting thrown out.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Not starting at zero, but rather resuming at where the greatest minds left<br>off.</div>

    <h2>How Evil...</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Alas, teaching whilst failing to educate, is fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Parading the coffee lovers, who want to breeze through with a 4.0 GPA, to<br>get the hell out, and move past this damn charade. Parading them as<br>successfully educated students, is fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Making the quiet girl cry because she wanted to comprehend and not merely<br>memorize, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Turning face away, when the fat kid is being bullied, beaten, assaulted,<br>threatened, kicked, held down, spat upon, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sending a kid back home, when you just witnessed his father beating him in<br>the bathroom for the bad grades he ended up with, because he can't memorize<br>anything when he is under constant threat from everybody, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Failing to authentically educate, and then grading down those who rejected<br>the memorization dog and pony show, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending to teach under the poisonous threat of repeating the grade or<br>year, semester or class, threatening kids to stop learning, and start<br>memorizing, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sending kids home to angry, often violent parents, because they rejected<br>fake education, fake tests, fantasy GPA, is evil.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And work...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Work would set us free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We were scared, because there was no road ahead. There was no clear<br>authentic future.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">At first we thought we were the losers. We certainly had the grades to<br>prove it. We formed a club. We sarcastically called it The Breakfast Club<br>after an old movie. We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">But we had the gift of courage, the gift of search for a clear road ahead.<br>And that road turned out to be becoming a Businessperson, a Founder, a CEO.<br>It was a path that mixed education with rewards, leading onward to<br>independence and a majestic triumph, albeit through many a failure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In school, we were being forced to memorize Trigonometry, Triceps and<br>Triceratops, when what we really needed was help with finding investors to<br>scale our little Breakfast Club business.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The threat of repeating classes, reliving the same noise, or being held<br>back was exactly like prison.

    <h2>People tried to help, but they didn't know how.</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Someone said that the only reason the teachers seemed to know more than we<br>did, was because they had to regurgitate that same stuff every year to keep<br>their jobs...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each time it came up; there was always someone to say that they wanted to<br>help us, but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and<br>destroy, embrace and extinguish. Get the gifted ones out of the system to<br>make things easier for themselves, to calm the waters - if nothing sticks<br>out, it must be all good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to cram<br>before a test, pass it, and forget it. Since tests did not represent<br>student knowledge, grades did not represent the student. Everyone knew<br>this, nobody said anything because once the students realized the school<br>was mostly a charade they just wanted to graduate and move on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Overwhelming majority of Teachers didn't want to change anything because<br>they didn't want to make their job any harder, they just want to get paid<br>and go home. Statistically half of them quit anyway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Management was focused on grade points and funding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everybody else was parading solutions, but there was no time, any extras<br>were aimed at symptoms, extras just added to the weight of existing<br>problems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The root cause was that we were not safe, and we were not learning.</div>
