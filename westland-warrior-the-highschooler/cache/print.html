    <h2>Notes from an Imaginary High School: A Quick Reminder</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to
    betray a student for a paycheck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired. Many felt
    bad about the level of education we were receiving.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But, whether they liked it or not, consciously or subconsciously, at the
    end of the day, it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize
    for long enough to pass standardized testing, and the administration didn't
    have a problem with that.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">They meant no harm, they did it so that they could get paid, so that the

    who didn't rise against it caused harm. They interfered with our real
    education, harming creativity, erasing individuality.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at home,
    that bullies were a fact, and life is never fair. They hurt our hearts, and
    shamed us by saying. "Oh, just grow up, already! Because, you need to
    improve your grades."</div>

    already today. The tomorrow they thought of, was more of a garbage can for
    nice-to-haves.</div>

    have the strength to do both, their job, and make schools work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In effect, everyone forgot about us. They forgot we were the point and the

  <div class="paragraph">We were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard, that
    the administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely
    stressful. People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">"Focus on the positive, on how hard we work and how far we've come

    <h2>Teaching is Complex and Rewarding</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Teaching should respectfully extend their existing knowledge. The teacher
    must know if fascination with Dinosaurs will head towards Paleontology,
    Biology, Ecology, and keep an eye on progression of that path (if said path
    continues) to see is they have a Cell Bilogist, Astrobiologist,
    Evolutionary Biologist, or maybe a Writer, in their class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward, how
    fantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary
    cross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean
    towards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, pushing her away from what moves her, grading her down for it, and
    forcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass
    the grade. That is something else... And the answer to how many children
    were hurt this way, is: <strong>all of them</strong>, in every school, on every
    continent, in every country, state and district.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schools interrupt education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius. They do
    it just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They destroy The Shy, The Delicate, The Compassionate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They destroy Pacifists, Leaders, Scientists, Inventors, Dreamers, Poets,
    Artists, Sculptors, Musicians, Adventures, Writers, Makers, Heroes.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Turning face away, when the fat kid is being bullied, beaten, assaulted,

  <div class="paragraph">Sending a kid back home, when you just witnessed his father beating him in
    the bathroom for the bad grades he ended up with, because he can't memorize
    anything when he is under constant threat from everybody, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Failing to authentically educate, and then grading down those who rejected
    the memorization dog and pony show, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending to teach under the poisonous threat of repeating the grade or
    year, semester or class, threatening kids to stop learning, and start
    memorizing, is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sending kids home to angry, often violent parents, because they rejected
    fake education, fake tests, fantasy GPA, is evil.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Each time it came up; there was always someone to say that they wanted to
    help us, but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and
    destroy, embrace and extinguish. Get the gifted ones out of the system to
    make things easier for themselves, to calm the waters - if nothing sticks
    out, it must be all good.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to cram
    before a test, pass it, and forget it. Since tests did not represent
    student knowledge, grades did not represent the student. Everyone knew
    this, nobody said anything because once the students realized the school
    was mostly a charade they just wanted to graduate and move on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Overwhelming majority of Teachers didn't want to change anything because
    they didn't want to make their job any harder, they just want to get paid
    and go home. Statistically half of them quit anyway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Management was focused on grade points and funding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everybody else was parading solutions, but there was no time, any extras
    were aimed at symptoms, extras just added to the weight of existing

    Rebels, The Troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who
    saw things differently, who were not fond of rules, and had no respect for
    the status quo.</div>
