Many felt\nbad about the level of education we were receiving.\nBut, whether they liked it or not, consciously or subconsciously, at the\nend of the day, it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize\nfor long enough to pass standardized testing, and the administration didn't\nhave a problem with that.\n\nDe-Grading Education by Elizabeth Wissner-Gross\n\nDe-Grading Education by Elizabeth Wissner-Gross\n\nPaved with Good Intentions\n\nThey meant no harm, they did it so that they could get paid, so that the\nschool could get funding, so that everyone would keep their job. But those\nwho didn't rise against it caused harm. They interfered with our real\neducation, harming creativity, erasing individuality.\nIn K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at home,\nthat bullies were a fact, and life is never fair. They hurt our hearts, and\nshamed us by saying. \"Oh, just grow up, already! Because, you need to\nimprove your grades.\"\n\nThe Surprising Truth About Learning in Schools by Will Richardson\n\nThe Surprising Truth About Learning in Schools by Will Richardson\n\nWe Were Mislead\n\n\"Today, we'll get it all working, and today we'll get paid. Tomorrow,\ntomorrow, when everything is worked-out and working, we'll get to the\nstudents - one thing at a time.\" - They'd say.\nBut we knew that tomorrow never comes, once the new day starts, it is\nalready today. The tomorrow they thought of, was more of a garbage can for\nnice-to-haves.\nThey were working very hard, and it was all very hard work. But they didn't\nhave the strength to do both, their job, and make schools work.\nIn effect, everyone forgot about us. They forgot we were the point and the\nfuture. Their aim was no longer our education, but merely staying in\nbusiness by arranging for what in effect became, an impression of one.\n\nTwists & Turns\n\nTo accomplish all this, some changes needed to be made, they first\nconvinced themselves that they were doing a great job so as long as they\nwere working hard, and then some things needed to be taken away, and a few\nneeded to be twisted around.\nWe were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard, that\nthe administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely\nstressful. People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices.\nTo question administration or teachers while they work that hard, makes for\na heartless, cruel, shameful petty little student.\n\nNataly Buhr\n\nNataly Buhr\n\nHow Unfortunate...\n\n\"Focus on the positive, on how hard we work and how far we've come\ntogether.\" - They'd say, ever so lovingly.\nVoid of context, many of the shallow arguments the teachers made could\nalmost stand up to a proper debate.\nBut we remained unconvinced because teaching is not just a job. It is not\nan ordinary job, and it is not just about knowledge.\n\nTeaching is Complex\n\nTeaching requires that the Teacher first comprehends each of the Students,\nunderstands their existing body of knowledge, manner of learning, and finds\na way to genuinely communicate with them.\nTracking is not that hard, a pencil or a Concept Mapping tool will do.\n\nConcept Mapping with Cmap\n\nConcept Mapping with Cmap\n\nTeaching is Complex and Rewarding\n\nTeaching should respectfully extend their existing knowledge. The teacher\nmust know if fascination with Dinosaurs will head towards Paleontology,\nBiology, Ecology, and keep an eye on progression of that path (if said path\ncontinues) to see is they have a Cell Bilogist, Astrobiologist,\nEvolutionary Biologist, or maybe a Writer, in their class.\nThe complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward, how\nfantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary\ncross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean\ntowards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career.\nNow, pushing her away from what moves her, grading her down for it, and\nforcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass\nthe grade. That is something else... And the answer to how many children\nwere hurt this way, is: all of them, in every school, on every\ncontinent, in every country, state and district.\nSchools interrupt education.\nThey destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius. They do\nit just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it.\nThey destroy The Shy, The Delicate, The Compassionate.\nThey destroy Pacifists, Leaders, Scientists, Inventors, Dreamers, Poets,\nArtists, Sculptors, Musicians, Adventures, Writers, Makers, Heroes.\n\nA picture of a real blackboard in a library taken from F**k Grades by\nDenise Dutton.\nProf. Dutton does not postulate a 2.* GPA student in her talk.\nI think the person that wrote this was a young woman. And this might have\nbeen her last act of defiance in that school.\nWe lost a wise and delicate being, a leader, a scientist, maybe a writer,\nto silence, rejection, shunning.\nThat late-night scribble is clear Evidence of Exceptional Ability. This is\nsomeone we each admire, someone Beautifully Courageous.\nBut she left, she's gone. They gave her a 2.0 for Leadership,\nUnbreakability, Heroism, for spending her last semester reading books she\nloved, at the school library she loved, right before getting thrown out.\nThrown out by people that didn't know what they were doing, but they sure\nas hell worked hard at doing it.\nThrown out for unobstructed pursuit of Wisdom.\n\nLux Et Veritas (Enlightenment and Authenticity)\n\nAbove all, school is a place of healing, it is a sacred place.\nThe School Library is even more sacred, it is a place for Young\nPhilosophers.\nSchool is about safety and security and protection, first.\nIt must be a place where we can safely grow, study both Life, and Wisdom.\nSearch for Enlightenment and Authenticity.\nEducation is about mental health, learning to live.\nLearning to avoid what is not life.\nNot starting at zero, but rather resuming at where the greatest minds left\noff.\nThe teachers were supposed to work for us first. Only upon genuinely\nenabling us to comprehend new things, should they be rewarded.\n\nHow Evil...\n\nAlas, teaching whilst failing to educate, is fraud.\nParading the coffee lovers, who want to breeze through with a 4.0 GPA, to\nget the hell out, and move past this damn charade. Parading them as\nsuccessfully educated students, is fraud.\nMaking the quiet girl cry because she wanted to comprehend and not merely\nmemorize, is evil.\nTurning face away, when the fat kid is being bullied, beaten, assaulted,\nthreatened, kicked, held down, spat upon, is evil.\nSending a kid back home, when you just witnessed his father beating him in\nthe bathroom for the bad grades he ended up with, because he can't memorize\nanything when he is under constant threat from everybody, is evil.\nFailing to authentically educate, and then grading down those who rejected\nthe memorization dog and pony show, is evil.\nPretending to teach under the poisonous threat of repeating the grade or\nyear, semester or class, threatening kids to stop learning, and start\nmemorizing, is evil.\nSending kids home to angry, often violent parents, because they rejected\nfake education, fake tests, fantasy GPA, is evil.\n\nDo schools kill creativity? by Sir Ken Robinson\n\nDo schools kill creativity? by Sir Ken Robinson\n\nToxic, Fractured, Hoop Jumping\n\nSchool doesn't just kill creativity, genius, talent, inspiration and\npassion, it kills learning too.\nThe toxic mixture of irrelevant babble, easy to cram for tests, and Life &\nCareer threatening GPA; forces the student to abandon Authentic Education\nfor curriculum-hoop jumping.\n\nF**k Grades by Denise Dutton\n\nF**k Grades by Denise Dutton\n\nWe Were All Geniuses, We Were Mislead\n\nWe were taught that genius is rare, that creativity is reserved for those\nwho have talent, that good grades get a good job, that only the smart ace\nthe tests, and that to pass a test we need to cram harder and take more\nnotes, that grade-point-average is the measure of a human - because that is\nhow the world works.\nAnd work...\nWork would set us free.\nWe were scared, because there was no road ahead. There was no clear\nauthentic future.\nNot without that same charade, that inauthenticity, that glass of fashion,\nthat mold of form that we were being pressed into, and everyone else\nalready accepted, and blindly participated in.\n\nErica Goldson\n\nErica Goldson\n\nTrigonometry, Triceps and Triceratops\n\nAt first we thought we were the losers. We certainly had the grades to\nprove it. We formed a club. We sarcastically called it The Breakfast Club\nafter an old movie. We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out.\nWe didn't expect to be seen as the gifted ones.\nBut we had the gift of courage, the gift of search for a clear road ahead.\nAnd that road turned out to be becoming a Businessperson, a Founder, a CEO.\nIt was a path that mixed education with rewards, leading onward to\nindependence and a majestic triumph, albeit through many a failure.\nIn school, we were being forced to memorize Trigonometry, Triceps and\nTriceratops, when what we really needed was help with finding investors to\nscale our little Breakfast Club business.\n\nHow School Makes Kids Less Intelligent by Eddy Zhong\n\nHow School Makes Kids Less Intelligent by Eddy Zhong\n\nThe Courageous & The Fallen\n\nThe others secretly saw us as courageous, strong and unbreakable, healthy\nand authentic. But they didn't really know how to relate to us. We were the\nsame but they were too confused by the noise of homework, quizzes, tests,\nand grades, chores, parents, circles, and punishment, punishment everywhere.\nThe threat of repeating classes, reliving the same noise, or being held\nback was exactly like prison.
