The Masters of the Stereo

A sample of sound, is the same as a sample of cake, it is just a littlebit of something larger. In the world of music, that little bit, wouldoften be a defining sound in a song that captured your attention.

Art of Sampling

Creating sounds with a synthesizer can be tiring, not every sound yousynthesize will be ground breaking. Back in the old days, listeners werenot too happy with synthesized songs, people would actually call them UFOSounds.
Some choose to skip sound synthesis and create/download samples.Samples can be replayed at different frequencies, depending on which pianokey you hit. In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almostrecreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at differentfrequencies/notes (A note like middle C, is just a named frequency, inthis case 261.63 Hz.)
Sampling is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, hats, even piano or some lo-tech violin out of flinging a doorstop. You can give beatboxing a try and build a song out of sampling/splicing the instruments you imitated with your own voice.
Downloadable Drumkits, are collections of short samples of instrumentstaken from various places, including other songs. Visit r/Drumkits forsome free downloads.
Additionally, freesound has a huge library, and Splice has a wellorganized one aimed at musicians for $7.99/mo (the free trial is worth it).

How to translate the feeling into sound by Claudio

Become a Rockstar!

Please remember what Claudio teaches us. A song is a story, it is not theback-beat, not the piano, not the twelve inch drum, or the bass head. Asong is a story told with voice and music.
Grab a pencil, draw a line. Mark all the important events along the line.That's where the lyrics start or end, that's where the back-beat slows orpicks up, that's where your listeners will start to laugh or start to cry.
We compose music, because the greatest of stories cannot be expressed inwords.
