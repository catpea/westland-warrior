The Masters of the Stereo
-------------------------

![The Masters of the Stereo](/image/stereo-master.jpg)

A **sample** of sound, is the same as a sample of cake, it is just a little  
bit of something larger. In the world of music, that little bit, would  
often be a defining sound in a song that captured your attention.

Art of Sampling
---------------

Creating sounds with a synthesizer can be tiring, not every sound you  
synthesize will be ground breaking. Back in the old days, listeners were  
not too happy with synthesized songs, people would actually call them UFO  
Sounds.

Some choose to skip sound synthesis and create/[download](https://old.reddit.com/r/Drumkits/) samples.  
Samples can be replayed at different frequencies, depending on which piano  
key you hit. In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almost  
recreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at different  
frequencies/notes (A note like _middle C_, is just a named frequency, in  
this case 261.63 Hz.)

[Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)) is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, [hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat), even piano or some lo-tech violin out of [flinging a doorstop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS4gZcjSHk4). You can give beatboxing a try and build a song out of sampling/splicing the instruments you imitated with your own voice.

Downloadable Drumkits, are collections of short samples of instruments  
taken from various places, including other songs. Visit [r/Drumkits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drumkits/) for  
some free downloads.

Additionally, [freesound](https://freesound.org/) has a huge library, and [Splice](https://splice.com/) has a well  
organized one aimed at musicians for $7.99/mo (the free trial is worth it).

How to translate the feeling into sound by Claudio
--------------------------------------------------

[![]( /image/yid-q5yxIzs5Wug.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5yxIzs5Wug)

Become a Rockstar!
------------------

Please remember what Claudio teaches us. A song is a story, it is not the  
back-beat, not the piano, not the twelve inch drum, or the bass head. A  
song is a story told with voice and music.

Grab a pencil, draw a line. Mark all the important events along the line.  
That's where the lyrics start or end, that's where the back-beat slows or  
picks up, that's where your listeners will start to laugh or start to cry.

We compose music, because the greatest of stories cannot be expressed in  
words.
