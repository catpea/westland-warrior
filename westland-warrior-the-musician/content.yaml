    A **sample** of sound, is the same as a sample of cake, it is just a little
    bit of something larger. In the world of music, that little bit, would
    often be a defining sound in a song that captured your attention.

  text: |-
    Creating sounds with a synthesizer can be tiring, not every sound you
    synthesize will be ground breaking. Back in the old days, listeners were
    not too happy with synthesized songs, people would actually call them UFO
    Sounds.

    Some choose to skip sound synthesis and create/[download][1] samples.
    Samples can be replayed at different frequencies, depending on which piano
    key you hit. In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almost
    recreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at different
    frequencies/notes (A note like _middle C_, is just a named frequency, in
    this case 261.63 Hz.)

    [Sampling][2] is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, [hats][3], even piano or some lo-tech violin out of [flinging a doorstop][4]. You can give beatboxing a try and build a song out of sampling/splicing the instruments you imitated with your own voice.

    Downloadable Drumkits, are collections of short samples of instruments
    taken from various places, including other songs. Visit [r/Drumkits][5] for
    some free downloads.

    Additionally, [freesound][6] has a huge library, and [Splice][7] has a well
    organized one aimed at musicians for $7.99/mo (the free trial is worth it).

    Please remember what Claudio teaches us. A song is a story, it is not the
    back-beat, not the piano, not the twelve inch drum, or the bass head. A
    song is a story told with voice and music.

    Grab a pencil, draw a line. Mark all the important events along the line.
    That's where the lyrics start or end, that's where the back-beat slows or
    picks up, that's where your listeners will start to laugh or start to cry.

    We compose music, because the greatest of stories cannot be expressed in
    words.

    Search YouTube for [Studio Acapellas][1] to discover vocal-only tracks of
    popular songs. It is much easier to understand what singing is about when
    you can hear the voice without music. You can search the web for "download
    youtube audio" and then load them into LMMS and create your own backbeat
    and remixes.
