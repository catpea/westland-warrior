    <h2>Great Battle</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming a Web Developer is like fighting in a Great Battle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you make a wrong move, <strong>you will lose</strong>, but gain wisdom for it, with<br>each failure you gain more wisdom, with each rebuild, you build faster.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Things can get toxic all too quickly, you will have to be ready to quit,<br>and retry. Like a Samurai, without thought, you release your Katana, cut<br>the job, move on.</div>

    <h2>What to Avoid</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">Below is the text from <span>Love building themes? Join the Theme Storecommunity at Shopify<sup>[3]</sup></span>, where website themes sell for $180.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(If you think you can handle this, go for it! Though, please note that they<br>are gently asking that you have a team, which could mean outsourcing, and a<br>budget for bug fixing. The platform for managing your outsourced team would<br>be <span>github<sup>[4]</sup></span> and <span>slack<sup>[5]</sup></span>, this is doable you could even experiment<br>paying your developers via <span>liberapay<sup>[6]</sup></span>)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I see that the posting below has too many restrictions. And if<br>your theme won't average 10 sales per month, they'll throw it out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know what their relationship is with <span>leading web designframeworks<sup>[7]</sup></span>. I don't think they have a rational streamlined pipeline.<br>Because, what they call bug fixing is a massive undertaking requiring<br><span>dozens of developers<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>

    <h2>What to Avoid</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform and we have no<br>plans to slow down! The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to<br>make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes<br>available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for<br>their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate<br>designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the<br>Theme Store.</div>
  <h5 id="important-information-to-know-before-you-apply">Important information to know before you apply</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme Partner<br>application:</div>
  <ul>
    <li> Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme<br>Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s),<br>and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a<br>lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who<br>are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you’ll need to<br>consider how you’ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are<br>currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in.</li>
    <li> Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect<br>potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the<br>Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s).</li>
    <li> We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes<br>ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme<br>Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way<br>during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with<br>you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack<br>channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your<br>theme-related questions and issues.</li>
    <li> The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30. The Theme Partner<br>receives 70% of each theme sale.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="what-to-submit-when-you-apply">What to submit when you apply</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">Please email themes@shopify.com and include all of the following:</div>
  <ol>
    <li> A link to an active Shopify website you built for a client. This must<br>be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client.</li>
    <li> A case study for the above Shopify website that details your<br>experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the<br>project and the client.</li>
    <li> A cover letter.</li>
    <li> A link to your design portfolio.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5 id="how-we-review-your-application">How we review your application</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">For the <strong>active Shopify website</strong> our review will cover:</div>
  <ul>
    <li> Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is<br>visible).</li>
    <li> Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme<br>from the Shopify Theme Store).</li>
    <li> Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall<br>originality).</li>
    <li> Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space,<br>responsiveness, grid, and alignment).</li>
    <li> Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text,<br>number of fonts used, and legibility of text).</li>
    <li> Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page).</li>
    <li> Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets).</li>
    <li> Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart<br>pages).</li>
    <li> Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website<br>functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors).</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="paragraph">For the <strong>case study</strong> we will be looking for you to provide this<br>information:</div>
  <ul>
    <li> What brought the client to you?</li>
    <li> What were the client’s needs?</li>
    <li> How did you go about solving their problem?</li>
    <li> We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and<br>refining), and what you learned.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="paragraph">For the <strong>cover letter</strong> we would like to see the following information:</div>
  <ul>
    <li> An outline of who you (and your team) are.</li>
    <li> Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community?</li>
    <li> Why you think you’d do well as a Theme Partner?</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="paragraph">Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter. We<br>highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering<br>applications.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For the <strong>design portfolio</strong> we will be reviewing the same design related<br>points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website:</div>
  <ul>
    <li> Art direction.</li>
    <li> Layout.</li>
    <li> Typography.</li>
    <li> Consistency.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="paragraph">The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed<br>feedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we do<br>reach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will work<br>with you on the next steps of the approval process.</div>
  <h5 id="your-theme-in-the-shopify-theme-store">Your theme in the Shopify Theme Store</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed via<br>the Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces<br>or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.</div>
  <h5 id="theme-support">Theme support</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout,<br>dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a<br>timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may<br>be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their<br>theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme<br>documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25<br>sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping<br>their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved<br>standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements<br>to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.</div>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up<br>struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the<br>30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into<br>the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.<br>Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under<br>active development, that is a lot of code updates.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with <span>morereasonable restrictions<sup>[10]</sup></span>. Take a look at the sales stats that they<br>parade right at their <span>front page<sup>[11]</sup></span>. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,<br>the <span>INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme<sup>[12]</sup></span> would have made 2.2 million USD.<br>Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now remember <span>INSPINIA<sup>[13]</sup></span> is sitting right on top of <span>Bootstrap<sup>[14]</sup></span> so<br><span>all this development is going on in the back<sup>[15]</sup></span> at no charge to <span>INSPINIADevelopers<sup>[16]</sup></span>. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the<br>latest updates to the <span>Bootstrap<sup>[17]</sup></span> code base.</div>

    <h2>Services Platform</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">The Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined,<br>low-liability versions of <span>wrapbootstrap.com<sup>[19]</sup></span>, <span>themes.shopify.com<sup>[20]</sup></span>,<br>or even <span>shopify.com<sup>[21]</sup></span> it self, and others that tickle your fancy in<br>similar ways.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected to<br>wrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense</div>
  <ul>
    <li>that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2<br>Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales (<span>3rd party sellers earn80%<sup>[22]</sup></span>).</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="paragraph">Your story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a step<br>above the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platform<br>like <span>wrapbootstrap.com<sup>[23]</sup></span> or <span>themes.shopify.com<sup>[24]</sup></span> for a monthly<br>membership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales.</div>

    <h2>Become a CEO</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even<br>about learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;<br>because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a<br>Founder, a CEO.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You shouldn't think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for<br>the web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference<br>between $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an<br>employee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.</div>
