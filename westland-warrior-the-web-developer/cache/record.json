Theme Partners are responsible for keeping\ntheir themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved\nstandards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements\nto the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nNow, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up\nstruggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the\n30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into\nthe world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.\nAside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under\nactive development, that is a lot of code updates.\nThere is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with more\nreasonable restrictions. Take a look at the sales stats that they\nparade right at their front page. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,\nthe INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme would have made 2.2 million USD.\nEven if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.\nNow remember INSPINIA is sitting right on top of Bootstrap so\nall this development is going on in the back at no charge to INSPINIA\nDevelopers. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the\nlatest updates to the Bootstrap code base.\n\nA Software Developer's Secret to Life by Julia Menchavez\n\nServices Platform\n\nThe Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined,\nlow-liability versions of wrapbootstrap.com, themes.shopify.com,\nor even shopify.com it self, and others that tickle your fancy in\nsimilar ways.\nNow when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected to\nwrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense\n\nthat WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2\nMillion Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales (3rd party sellers earn\n80%).\n\nYour story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a step\nabove the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platform\nlike wrapbootstrap.com or themes.shopify.com for a monthly\nmembership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales.\n\nBecome a CEO\n\nWeb Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even\nabout learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;\nbecause you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).\nIt is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a\nFounder, a CEO.\nYou shouldn't think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for\nthe web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference\nbetween $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an\nemployee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.\n\n\n[Love building themes?
