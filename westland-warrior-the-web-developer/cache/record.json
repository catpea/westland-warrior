This would also mean that they made 2.2\n   Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales (3rd party sellers earn80%[22]).\n\nYour story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a step\nabove the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platform\nlike wrapbootstrap.com[23] or themes.shopify.com[24] for a monthly\nmembership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales.\n\nBECOME A CEO\n\nWeb Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even\nabout learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;\nbecause you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).\nIt is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a\nFounder, a CEO.\nYou shouldn't think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for\nthe web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference\nbetween $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an\nemployee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASbijZRU2Uo\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NzNs8FAudQ\n[3]: https://themes.shopify.com/services/themes/guidelines\n[4]: https://github.com/\n[5]: https://slack.com/\n[6]: https://liberapay.com/\n[7]: https://github.com/topics/css\n[8]: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/graphs/contributors\n[9]: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse/monthly\n[10]: https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/submission-guidelines-themes-and-templates\n[11]: https://wrapbootstrap.com/\n[12]: https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S\n[13]: https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S\n[14]: https://getbootstrap.com/\n[15]: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse\n[16]: https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers\n[17]: https://getbootstrap.com/\n[18]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj0kReMs-gc\n[19]: https://wrapbootstrap.com\n[20]: https://themes.shopify.com/\n[21]: https://shopify.com/\n[22]: https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/fee-structure\n[23]: https://wrapbootstrap.com\n[24]: https://themes.shopify.com/",
