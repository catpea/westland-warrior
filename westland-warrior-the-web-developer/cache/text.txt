How I Became a Web Developer in 3 Months

Passion, Programming, and Pragmatism by Marcella Jewell

Great Battle

Becoming a Web Developer is like fighting in a Great Battle.
If you make a wrong move, you will lose, but gain wisdom for it, witheach failure you gain more wisdom, with each rebuild, you build faster.
Things can get toxic all too quickly, you will have to be ready to quit,and retry. Like a Samurai, without thought, you release your Katana, cutthe job, move on.

What to Avoid

Below is the text from Love building themes? Join the Theme Storecommunity at Shopify, where website themes sell for $180.
(If you think you can handle this, go for it! Though, please note that theyare gently asking that you have a team, which could mean outsourcing, and abudget for bug fixing. The platform for managing your outsourced team wouldbe github and slack, this is doable you could even experimentpaying your developers via liberapay)
Personally, I see that the posting below has too many restrictions. And ifyour theme won't average 10 sales per month, they'll throw it out.
I don't know what their relationship is with leading web designframeworks. I don't think they have a rational streamlined pipeline.Because, what they call bug fixing is a massive undertaking requiringdozens of developers.
The most widely developed foundation for themes, after many years ofdevelopment had 60 issues last month alone (November 2019).

What to Avoid

Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform and we have noplans to slow down!

The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailedfeedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we doreach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will workwith you on the next steps of the approval process.
Your theme in the Shopify Theme Store
Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed viathe Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplacesor third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.
Theme support
If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout,dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in atimely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme maybe temporarily removed from the Theme Store.
Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use theirtheme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, themedocumentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.
Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keepingtheir themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improvedstandards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvementsto the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.

The Challenge

Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-upstruggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look intothe world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are underactive development, that is a lot of code updates.
There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with morereasonable restrictions. Take a look at the sales stats that theyparade right at their front page. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,the INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme would have made 2.2 million USD.Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.
Now remember INSPINIA is sitting right on top of Bootstrap soall this development is going on in the back at no charge to INSPINIADevelopers. All they do is add more components, and keep up with thelatest updates to the Bootstrap code base.

Services Platform

The Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined,low-liability versions of wrapbootstrap.com, themes.shopify.com,or even shopify.com it self, and others that tickle your fancy insimilar ways.
Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected towrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense

that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales (3rd party sellers earn80%).

Your story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a stepabove the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platformlike wrapbootstrap.com or themes.shopify.com for a monthlymembership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales.

Become a CEO

Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not evenabout learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).
It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, aFounder, a CEO.
You shouldn't think of a web developer as a person that merely develops forthe web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a differencebetween $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, anemployee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.
