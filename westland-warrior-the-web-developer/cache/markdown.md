Great Battle
------------

Becoming a Web Developer is like fighting in a Great Battle.

If you make a wrong move, **you will lose**, but gain wisdom for it, with  
each failure you gain more wisdom, with each rebuild, you build faster.

Things can get toxic all too quickly, you will have to be ready to quit,  
and retry. Like a Samurai, without thought, you release your Katana, cut  
the job, move on.

What to Avoid
-------------

Below is the text from [Love building themes? Join the Theme Store  
community at Shopify](https://themes.shopify.com/services/themes/guidelines), where website themes sell for $180.

(If you think you can handle this, go for it! Though, please note that they  
are gently asking that you have a team, which could mean outsourcing, and a  
budget for bug fixing. The platform for managing your outsourced team would  
be [github](https://github.com/) and [slack](https://slack.com/), this is doable you could even experiment  
paying your developers via [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/))

Personally, I see that the posting below has too many restrictions. And if  
your theme won't average 10 sales per month, they'll throw it out.

I don't know what their relationship is with [leading web design  
frameworks](https://github.com/topics/css). I don't think they have a rational streamlined pipeline.  
Because, what they call bug fixing is a massive undertaking requiring  
[dozens of developers](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/graphs/contributors).

The most widely developed foundation for themes, after many years of  
development had [60 issues](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse/monthly) last month alone (November 2019).

What to Avoid
-------------

Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform and we have no  
plans to slow down! The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to  
make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes  
available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for  
their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate  
designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the  
Theme Store.

##### Important information to know before you apply

Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme Partner  
application:

*   Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme  
    Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s),  
    and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner.
*   Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a  
    lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who  
    are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you’ll need to  
    consider how you’ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are  
    currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in.
*   Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect  
    potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the  
    Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s).
*   We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes  
    ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme  
    Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way  
    during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with  
    you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack  
    channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your  
    theme-related questions and issues.
*   The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30. The Theme Partner  
    receives 70% of each theme sale.

##### What to submit when you apply

Please email themes@shopify.com and include all of the following:

1.  A link to an active Shopify website you built for a client. This must  
    be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client.
2.  A case study for the above Shopify website that details your  
    experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the  
    project and the client.
3.  A cover letter.
4.  A link to your design portfolio.

##### How we review your application

For the **active Shopify website** our review will cover:

*   Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is  
    visible).
*   Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme  
    from the Shopify Theme Store).
*   Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall  
    originality).
*   Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space,  
    responsiveness, grid, and alignment).
*   Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text,  
    number of fonts used, and legibility of text).
*   Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page).
*   Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets).
*   Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart  
    pages).
*   Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website  
    functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors).

For the **case study** we will be looking for you to provide this  
information:

*   What brought the client to you?
*   What were the client’s needs?
*   How did you go about solving their problem?
*   We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and  
    refining), and what you learned.

For the **cover letter** we would like to see the following information:

*   An outline of who you (and your team) are.
*   Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community?
*   Why you think you’d do well as a Theme Partner?

Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter. We  
highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering  
applications.

For the **design portfolio** we will be reviewing the same design related  
points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website:

*   Art direction.
*   Layout.
*   Typography.
*   Consistency.

The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed  
feedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we do  
reach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will work  
with you on the next steps of the approval process.

##### Your theme in the Shopify Theme Store

Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed via  
the Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces  
or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.

##### Theme support

If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout,  
dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a  
timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may  
be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.

Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their  
theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme  
documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.

Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25  
sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping  
their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved  
standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements  
to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.

The Challenge
-------------

Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up  
struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the  
30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into  
the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.  
Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under  
active development, that is a lot of code updates.

There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with [more  
reasonable restrictions](https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/submission-guidelines-themes-and-templates). Take a look at the sales stats that they  
parade right at their [front page](https://wrapbootstrap.com/). At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,  
the [INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S) would have made 2.2 million USD.  
Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.

Now remember [INSPINIA](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S) is sitting right on top of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) so  
[all this development is going on in the back](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse) at no charge to [INSPINIA  
Developers](https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers). All they do is add more components, and keep up with the  
latest updates to the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) code base.

A Software Developer's Secret to Life by Julia Menchavez
--------------------------------------------------------

[![](/image/yid-uj0kReMs-gc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj0kReMs-gc)

Services Platform
-----------------

The Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined,  
low-liability versions of [wrapbootstrap.com](https://wrapbootstrap.com), [themes.shopify.com](https://themes.shopify.com/),  
or even [shopify.com](https://shopify.com/) it self, and others that tickle your fancy in  
similar ways.

Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected to  
wrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense

*   that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2  
    Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales ([3rd party sellers earn  
    80%](https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/fee-structure)).

Your story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a step  
above the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platform  
like [wrapbootstrap.com](https://wrapbootstrap.com) or [themes.shopify.com](https://themes.shopify.com/) for a monthly  
membership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales.

Become a CEO
------------

Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even  
about learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;  
because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).

It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a  
Founder, a CEO.

You shouldn't think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for  
the web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference  
between $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an  
employee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.
