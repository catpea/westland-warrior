    Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or
    Happiness, or Success, it will ensue from pursuit of things that seem just
    out of your reach.

  title: The Big Three
  text: |-
    The workout consists of three complementary exercises arranged in a way
    that I don’t have to stop.

    1.  [Dumbbell Lateral Raise][1]
    2.  [Standing Dumbbell Curls][2]
    3.  [Overhead Shoulder Press][3]

    Combined with dancing, which in this context is a form of stretching that
    doubles as a cardio workout.

    Good examples of fine workout songs are [Blade’s Blood Rave][4] for fast
    cardio and [Blanco Brown’s The Git Up][5] for rest and some stretching.

    I find it really helpful to add sugar to my workout water, but I am sure
    candy works just as well. Sweetened water (sometimes V8 tomato juice) and
    good music are the two things that I find most helpful during my routine.

    In weight lifting there maybe difficult discomfort 5 – 10 lifts into some
    routine, then you switch to some other exercise (for example from [Standing
    Dumbbell Curls][6] to [Overhead Shoulder Press][7] where your biceps rest
    while you perform the shoulder press), you never sit, you never lie, you
    use both arms, both legs, you don’t stop to rest. **If you need to stop
    then your weights are too heavy**, and your workout is not working out.

    Start in the beginning, come to the end, and then stop. Start with 3.5lb
    per hand, even if out of humility, even if just to remind yourself that you
    always start in the beginning, and you always finish what you start.

    There is no struggle because of music, the parts of your brain that are
    telling you to stop are weak. They are weaker than the beat of drums, they
    are weaker than a pretty song.

    Workout to the beats of songs, here is a player I eventually settled on:
    [Professional MP3 HIFI Music Player][1] it costs US $24.80 it is OK, I
    think. It does not seem Professional, I think it is just because phones are
    really good these days.

  title: Interval Timers
  text: |-
    If you need precision use [this tool][1] to get a BPM on a song to make a
    playlist, and if you are still having difficulty with non-stop exercise
    despite a chain of slow songs, then use a computer to keep track of your
    rests. I used an Interval Timer from [https://www.gymboss.com/][2]

    Keep lowering that rest period until no rest is needed in your routine.

  title: The Timer
  text: |-
    Interval timer will vibrate on start and stop of both exercise and rest. It
    will count down the number of exercise-rest sequences. By gradually
    lowering rest period and increasing exercise-rest sequences you will easily
    increase your endurance.
- type: text
  title: Avoid Counting
  text: |-
    Your body will trick you into stopping too early if you rely on counting.
    Interval Timers remove the distraction of constantly asking "Is it enough",
    and help you switch to "I will make it to the end".

    Use the beat of songs to further distract yourself from quitting. You will
    not gain endurance if you stop when your body begins hurting, you have to
    signal your body that is has to adapt because there is no stopping.

    Remember, you must signal your body that adaptation to exertion is
    required. You must not allow your body to force you to stop as that will
    void the exercise and your body will not receive any adaptation signals.

    No adaptation signals, no change to your strength and endurance.

  title: Back Pain
  text: |-
    Significant Injuries are more likely if you lift heavy. If you lift heavy a
    few times, your muscles will not be in a flexible enough state to handle
    it. Eventually you will pull a muscle, hurt yourself. If you lift 5lb
    10,000 times, the chances of getting hurt are much lower. Back pain is
    still likely to occur, you will need a proper bed, I use the inexpensive

  text: |-
    Raising your legs, raising your upper body, curving your spine will let
    your body rest. A flat mattress will attempt to straighten the natural
    curve to your lower back, in combination with lifting weights for prolonged
    periods, this is a recipe for disaster. You must let your back-muscles
    relax.

  title: Electrolytes
  text: |-
    While our cooling is superior, we do lose electrolytes while we sweat, you
    need to put them back in. V8 vegetable juice which contains both sodium and
    potassium is one way to do so, but always with wisdom and in moderation.

  title: No Rest
  text: |-
    Finally we arrive to the point where I explain why you can’t take days off.
    Think of your body as a good horse to your mind. Take two horses with
    muscle atrophy, one walks ten steps three times, every other day weekends
    off, the other trots for eight and half hours every day for many years, no
    day off. Which horse would you bet on, which horse would have more muscle,
    which horse would live healthier?

    The staying in the moment that he describes can be induced with a fun and snappy playlist, where non-stop endurance bodybuilding is concerned.
    Ultra-marathons are different from endurance workouts, they take longer and you certainly don’t want to depend on your mp3 player to finish.
    At the same time ultra-marathons have relative silence and it is easier to focus in the middle of an interesting run.
