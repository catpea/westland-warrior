    In moving. In endless horizons, and mountains, and the sea; we learn to
    break away, and find our own paths. And there is a slope to each adventure
    that follows, and the adventurer knows that slope must increase, and the
    challenges must grow also.

    Strength does not reside in having never been broken, but in the courage
    required to grow strong in the broken places.

    [Christopher Johnson McCandless, aka Alexander Supertramp, aka Alex][1] teaches us important lessons about the unbreakability of the human spirit, the danger of loneliness, and about the nearly irresistible beauty of the call to the wild.

    [Jon Krakauer][2] wrote a book about Alex entitled [Into the Wild][3], and there is also a [movie][4].

    No matter how dark our origins. No matter where we stand, and where we are
    headed. We are each charged with becoming a great being, by growing up, by
    growing all the way up.

    On a wounded knee, is no way to be free. Wherever we come from,
    Authenticity is our candle in the dark.

    Carine McCandless, Christopherâ€™s sister, explains a lot more about his
    journey.

    Our search for wisdom, as well as our climb onto the shoulders of giants,
    is just the first part of our story. When we learn to push ourselves to
    travel the hardest slopes, our shoulders will become strong enough to
    support the countless adventurers that are sure to follow. Long after we
    depart, our hard earned wisdom will retain the momentum of our hardest
    slopes, to serve as an inextinguishable candle in the dark.
