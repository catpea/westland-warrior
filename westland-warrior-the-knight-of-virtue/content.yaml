  text: |-
    As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring
    clans of duty and loyalty a new kind of class emerged.

    The Knight of Virtue.

    Internal influences are as just as powerful at changing a human, as the
    external ones. To internalize Knightly Virtues, to live by them, to triumph
    by them, became a sure way to become a hero.

    **Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.**

    My good blade carves the casques of men,

    My tough lance thrusteth sure,

    My strength is as the strength of ten,

    Because my heart is pure.

    Superheroes like [Galahad][1] carried a message that put servitude second.
    For one cannot uphold the Knightly Virtues whilst blindly following orders
    issued by someone who does not strive to uphold them.

  text: |-
    The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not
    forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one
    heart holds it bright.

    The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade
    defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only
    truth, His wrath undoes the wicked.

    Chivalry! - why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection, - the
    stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power
    of the tyrant - Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty
    finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.

    What we know of the superheroes of middle ages comes from poems and
    recreations of the lost arts.

    By subtle analogy to high pursuits in modern era, we can estimate that to
    aim for greatness, to climb the highest of mountains built Hardihood,
    enabled Largesse, taught Benevolence, and helped with Honour.

    The stories of Virtuous Knights are journeys of pursuit of knowledge, and
    self discovery, of trials and tribulations, of overcoming and rising, of
    triumph and disaster.

    To search for the Grail, or Arthur, Percival, or Galahad, and the others;
    was to find the Knightly Virtues and Wisdom set to timeless songs and poems.
