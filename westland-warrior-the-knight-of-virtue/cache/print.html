  <div class="paragraph">As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring<br>clans of duty and loyalty a new kind of class emerged.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Knight of Virtue.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Internal influences are as just as powerful at changing a human, as the<br>external ones. To internalize Knightly Virtues, to live by them, to triumph<br>by them, became a sure way to become a hero.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.</strong></div>

  <div class="paragraph">The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not<br>forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one<br>heart holds it bright.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade<br>defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only<br>truth, His wrath undoes the wicked.</div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Chivalry! - why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection, - the<br>stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power<br>of the tyrant - Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty<br>finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.</p>

    <h2>Above the Common Levels</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">By subtle analogy to high pursuits in modern era, we can estimate that to<br>aim for greatness, to climb the highest of mountains built Hardihood,<br>enabled Largesse, taught Benevolence, and helped with Honour.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The stories of Virtuous Knights are journeys of pursuit of knowledge, and<br>self discovery, of trials and tribulations, of overcoming and rising, of<br>triumph and disaster.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To search for the Grail, or Arthur, Percival, or Galahad, and the others;<br>was to find the Knightly Virtues and Wisdom set to timeless songs and poems.</div>
