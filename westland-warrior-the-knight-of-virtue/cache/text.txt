SIR GALAHAD

As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring
clans of duty and loyalty a new kind of class emerged.
The Knight of Virtue.
Internal influences are as just as powerful at changing a human, as the
external ones. To internalize Knightly Virtues, to live by them, to triumph
by them, became a sure way to become a hero.
Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.

SIR GALAHAD

ALFRED LORD TENNYSON

My good blade carves the casques of men,
My tough lance thrusteth sure,
My strength is as the strength of ten,
Because my heart is pure.

MEN OF PURE HEART

Superheroes like Galahad[1] carried a message that put servitude second.
For one cannot uphold the Knightly Virtues whilst blindly following orders
issued by someone who does not strive to uphold them.

KNIGHT'S OATH

The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not
forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one
heart holds it bright.
The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade
defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only
truth, His wrath undoes the wicked.

AUTHENTICITY

A code of conduct that aimed to revolve around Authenticity, was born.

QUOTE BY WALTER SCOTT

> Chivalry! - why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection, - the
> stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power
> of the tyrant - Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty
> finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.

> Walter Scott

PURSUITS OF EXCELLENCE

What we know of the superheroes of middle ages comes from poems and
recreations of the lost arts.
King Arthur's Origins[2]
Swordplay and the Lost Art of Knighthood[3]

ABOVE THE COMMON LEVELS

By subtle analogy to high pursuits in modern era, we can estimate that to
aim for greatness, to climb the highest of mountains built Hardihood,
enabled Largesse, taught Benevolence, and helped with Honour.
The stories of Virtuous Knights are journeys of pursuit of knowledge, and
self discovery, of trials and tribulations, of overcoming and rising, of
triumph and disaster.
To search for the Grail, or Arthur, Percival, or Galahad, and the others;
was to find the Knightly Virtues and Wisdom set to timeless songs and poems.
