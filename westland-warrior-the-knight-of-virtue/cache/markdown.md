Sir Galahad

![Sir Galahad](/image/galahad.jpg)

As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring  
clans of duty and loyalty a new kind of class emerged.

The Knight of Virtue.

Internal influences are as just as powerful at changing a human, as the  
external ones. To internalize Knightly Virtues, to live by them, to triumph  
by them, became a sure way to become a hero.

**Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.**

Sir Galahad by Alfred Lord Tennyson
-----------------------------------

My good blade carves the casques of men,

My tough lance thrusteth sure,

My strength is as the strength of ten,

Because my heart is pure.

Men of Pure Heart
-----------------

Superheroes like [Galahad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galahad) carried a message that put servitude second.  
For one cannot uphold the Knightly Virtues whilst blindly following orders  
issued by someone who does not strive to uphold them.

Knight's Oath by
----------------

The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not  
forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one  
heart holds it bright.

The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade  
defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only  
truth, His wrath undoes the wicked.

Authenticity
------------

A code of conduct that aimed to revolve around Authenticity, was born.

Quote by Walter Scott

Pursuits of Excellence

What we know of the superheroes of middle ages comes from poems and  
recreations of the lost arts.

Above the Common Levels
-----------------------

By subtle analogy to high pursuits in modern era, we can estimate that to  
aim for greatness, to climb the highest of mountains built Hardihood,  
enabled Largesse, taught Benevolence, and helped with Honour.

The stories of Virtuous Knights are journeys of pursuit of knowledge, and  
self discovery, of trials and tribulations, of overcoming and rising, of  
triumph and disaster.

To search for the Grail, or Arthur, Percival, or Galahad, and the others;  
was to find the Knightly Virtues and Wisdom set to timeless songs and poems.
