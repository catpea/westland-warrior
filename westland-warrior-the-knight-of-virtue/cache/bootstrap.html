      <p>As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring
        clans of duty and loyalty a new kind of class emerged.</p>
      <p>The Knight of Virtue.</p>
      <p>Internal influences are as just as powerful at changing a human, as the
        external ones. To internalize Knightly Virtues, to live by them, to triumph
        by them, became a sure way to become a hero.</p>
      <p><strong>Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.</strong></p>

      <p>The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Chivalry! - why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection, - the
        stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power
        of the tyrant - Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty
        finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.</p>

      <p>By subtle analogy to high pursuits in modern era, we can estimate that to
        aim for greatness, to climb the highest of mountains built Hardihood,
        enabled Largesse, taught Benevolence, and helped with Honour.</p>
      <p>The stories of Virtuous Knights are journeys of pursuit of knowledge, and
        self discovery, of trials and tribulations, of overcoming and rising, of
        triumph and disaster.</p>
      <p>To search for the Grail, or Arthur, Percival, or Galahad, and the others;
        was to find the Knightly Virtues and Wisdom set to timeless songs and poems.</p>
