You are needed, and your lasting contributions  \nare necessary.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann On Emergence\n-----------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-ONiWmzrmfuY.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONiWmzrmfuY)\n\nGrowing Up\n----------\n\nHumanity must break away from the circles. Progress in the larger world,  \nbegins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, “I am not  \nsmart enough”, “I am not a hero”, “I will never be heard”, “I will never be  \nenough”, “Too Scary!”. That is how every hero begun, by measuring up; and  \nthen by growing up to the challenges before us.\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\n-------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-hTlrSYbCbHE.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTlrSYbCbHE)\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\n-------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-5RR4VXNX3jA.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RR4VXNX3jA)\n\nNew Voices\n----------\n\nThe [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://librivox.org/the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights-by-the-united-nations/) needs work, each generation  \nneeds to update it and extend it beyond what it is today, grant it new  \nvoices - and there are bright new voices to be heard.\n\nMad world - the voice of china\n------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-z2tmRpm4iK8.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2tmRpm4iK8)\n\nNever Silenced\n--------------\n\nAnd there are voices that never stopped, fell out of the modern spotlight,  \nbut were never silenced, and never tired. No more circles.\n\nMichelle Alexander\n------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-SQ6H-Mz6hgw.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6H-Mz6hgw)\n\nQuote by Michelle Alexander\n---------------------------\n\n> I hope we will commit ourselves to building a human rights movement to end  \n> mass incarceration. A movement for education, not incarceration. A movement  \n> for jobs, not jails, and a movement to end all those forms of legal  \n> discrimination against people released from prison. Discrimination denying  \n> them basic human rights to work, to shelter, and to food.\n> \n> \\-- Michelle Alexander\n\nMichelle Alexander\n------------------\n\n73.5 million people in the United States have a criminal record. [Michelle  \nAlexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Alexander) wrote a book entitled [The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration  \nin the Age of Colorblindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow) which is also available as an  \n[Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-New-Jim-Crow-Audiobook/B007QW236E)\n\nBryan Stevenson: We need to talk about an injustice.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-c2tOp7OxyQ8.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8)\n\nQuote by Bryan Stevenson\n------------------------\n\n> _“Each of us is more, than the worst thing we’ve ever done.”_\n> \n> _“Our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity.”_\n> \n> _“Opposite of poverty is justice.”_\n> \n> \\-- Bryan Stevenson\n\nBryan Stevenson\n---------------\n\n[Bryan Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Stevenson) has helped achieve United States Supreme Court decisions that prohibit sentencing children under 18 to death or to life imprisonment without parole.\n\nHow America's public schools keep kids in poverty: Kandice Sumner\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-7O7BMa9XGXE.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O7BMa9XGXE)\n\nKandice Sumner's Prevention\n---------------------------\n\n[Kandice Sumner's](https://www.ted.com/speakers/kandace_sumner) idea beyond share & donate, is **prevention**. She sees young children asking powerful questions. She is trying to help them inherit wisdom from books, stories, history, and push them away from poverty.\n\nHeroes Lost\n-----------\n\nIt is heartbreaking that videos like “Don’t Talk to the Police” must exist.  \nA Police Officer must also be a Hero, a force of Goodness. Any compromise  \nbetween good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil.\n\nDon't Talk to the Police\n------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-d-7o9xYp7eE.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE)\n\nThe Walkouts\n------------\n\nDecember 10th, is [The Human Rights Day](https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/) and yet again, the hopelessness  \nturns to hope as we are granted a globally recognized focal point, and an  \nopportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants.\n\nWhen this nation is ready, December 10th will become the walkout day. For  \nDistrict Judges, their staff, Attorneys, their assistants, for Bad Cops,  \nGood Police Officers, and their COs. On their mind will be the thought,  \nthat to create a life long, legal, discrimination against an individual, is  \na Human Rights violation. It should be impossible to ask the legal  \ncommunity to follow the rule of law in the short term, and violate Human  \nRights in the long run.\n\nPoverty of Mind\n---------------\n\nPoverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that  \nopposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.  \nCan we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would likely  \nnot commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty? Every child  \nhas a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons, Astrophysics -  \ngoodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astrobiology. But poverty is  \nextremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in it self, but in  \nthe surrounding culture that it frequently creates. Poverty is a virus  \narmed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia, violence, and dark  \nblind stupidity.\n\nHow I spent 32 years in prison by George Martorano\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-lnuoHywbaR8.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8)\n\nThe Challenge\n-------------\n\nSome years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander  \nput us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many  \nmore things right.\n\nIn great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise your  \nchildren, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the  \nwall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up  \nhigh enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,  \nis not optional.\n\nMy Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is  \nnull and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal  \nDeclaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and  \nvoid. We are one family, one people.\n\nI ask you to build homes with the belief that [the inherent dignity and  \nequal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the  \nfoundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html), because  \nour humanity depends on everyone’s humanity.\n\nThe Hero and The Runaway\n------------------------\n\n![The Hero and The Runaway](/image/the-runaway.jpg)\n\nWe'll put things right, we'll fix it all.\n\nHeroism\n-------\n\nDon’t be frightened of becoming a hero. It is always the longest possible  \nway there, and it is always on the shoulders of giants, my friends.\n\nBy rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes,  \nof great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world  \nforever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.\n\nThe job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the  \nway up.\n\nAll the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one  \nplace where we can each share in them, where every member of the human  \nfamily can Converge on Wisdom.\n\nWorld Crisis\n------------\n\n![World Crisis](/image/school.png)\n\nThe human family is not divided by political borders. Kandice’s kids aren’t  \nthe only kids that need help. This is not just a national crisis, it is a  \nglobal one.\n\n[A school under Metro bridge teaches these Delhi slum children](https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/a-school-under-metro-bridge-teaches-these-delhi-slum-children/story-Qr3EV279SarAME4K6N8orL.html)",

  "text": "Peace Corps[1]\n\nLIVE DELIBERATELY\n\nI beg the youngest of you, to arrange your life in such a way so that each\nchallenge before you, is the hardest thing you have ever done.\nTo paraphrase Thoreau: I beg you to live and grow up deliberately, to front\nonly the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to teach,\nand not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend, had. not.\nyet. lived.\nLife is not random, it is not an accident, you are an emergent plateau in\nan infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting contributions\nare necessary.\nMurray Gell-Mann On Emergence[2]\n\nGROWING UP\n\nHumanity must break away from the circles. Progress in the larger world,\nbegins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, “I am not\nsmart enough”, “I am not a hero”, “I will never be heard”, “I will never be\nenough”, “Too Scary!”. That is how every hero begun, by measuring up; and\nthen by growing up to the challenges before us.\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights[3]\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights[4]\n\nNEW VOICES\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights[5] needs work, each generation\nneeds to update it and extend it beyond what it is today, grant it new\nvoices - and there are bright new voices to be heard.\nMad world - the voice of china[6]\n\nNEVER SILENCED\n\nAnd there are voices that never stopped, fell out of the modern spotlight,\nbut were never silenced, and never tired. No more circles.\nMichelle Alexander[7]\n\nQUOTE BY MICHELLE ALEXANDER\n\n> I hope we will commit ourselves to building a human rights movement to end\n> mass incarceration. A movement for education, not incarceration. A movement\n> for jobs, not jails, and a movement to end all those forms of legal\n> discrimination against people released from prison. Discrimination denying\n> them basic human rights to work, to shelter, and to food.\n> \n> Michelle Alexander\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER\n\n73.5 million people in the United States have a criminal record. MichelleAlexander[8] wrote a book entitled The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarcerationin the Age of Colorblindness[9] which is also available as an\nAudiobook[10]\nBryan Stevenson: We need to talk about an injustice.[11]\n\nQUOTE BY BRYAN STEVENSON\n\n> “Each of us is more, than the worst thing we’ve ever done.”\n> \n> “Our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity.”\n> \n> “Opposite of poverty is justice.”\n> \n> Bryan Stevenson\n\nBRYAN STEVENSON\n\nBryan Stevenson[12] has helped achieve United States Supreme Court decisions that prohibit sentencing children under 18 to death or to life imprisonment without parole.\nHow America's public schools keep kids in poverty: Kandice Sumner[13]\n\nKANDICE SUMNER'S PREVENTION\n\nKandice Sumner's[14] idea beyond share & donate, is prevention. She sees young children asking powerful questions. She is trying to help them inherit wisdom from books, stories, history, and push them away from poverty.\n\nHEROES LOST\n\nIt is heartbreaking that videos like “Don’t Talk to the Police” must exist.\nA Police Officer must also be a Hero, a force of Goodness. Any compromise\nbetween good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil.\nDon't Talk to the Police[15]\n\nTHE WALKOUTS\n\nDecember 10th, is The Human Rights Day[16] and yet again, the hopelessness\nturns to hope as we are granted a globally recognized focal point, and an\nopportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants.\nWhen this nation is ready, December 10th will become the walkout day. For\nDistrict Judges, their staff, Attorneys, their assistants, for Bad Cops,\nGood Police Officers, and their COs. On their mind will be the thought,\nthat to create a life long, legal, discrimination against an individual, is\na Human Rights violation. It should be impossible to ask the legal\ncommunity to follow the rule of law in the short term, and violate Human\nRights in the long run.\n\nPOVERTY OF MIND\n\nPoverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that\nopposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.\nCan we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would likely\nnot commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty? Every child\nhas a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons, Astrophysics -\ngoodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astrobiology. But poverty is\nextremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in it self, but in\nthe surrounding culture that it frequently creates. Poverty is a virus\narmed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia, violence, and dark\nblind stupidity.\nHow I spent 32 years in prison by George Martorano[17]\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\n\nSome years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander\nput us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many\nmore things right.\nIn great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise your\nchildren, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the\nwall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up\nhigh enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,\nis not optional.\nMy Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is\nnull and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and\nvoid. We are one family, one people.\nI ask you to build homes with the belief that the inherent dignity andequal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are thefoundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world[18], because\nour humanity depends on everyone’s humanity.\n\nTHE HERO AND THE RUNAWAY\n\nWe'll put things right, we'll fix it all.\n\nHEROISM\n\nDon’t be frightened of becoming a hero. It is always the longest possible\nway there, and it is always on the shoulders of giants, my friends.\nBy rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes,\nof great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world\nforever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.\nThe job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the\nway up.\nAll the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one\nplace where we can each share in them, where every member of the human\nfamily can Converge on Wisdom.\n\nWORLD CRISIS\n\nThe human family is not divided by political borders. Kandice’s kids aren’t\nthe only kids that need help. This is not just a national crisis, it is a\nglobal one.\nA school under Metro bridge teaches these Delhi slum children[19]\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxR8XZOeV-s\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONiWmzrmfuY\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTlrSYbCbHE\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RR4VXNX3jA\n[5]: https://librivox.org/the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights-by-the-united-nations/\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2tmRpm4iK8\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6H-Mz6hgw\n[8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Alexander\n[9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow\n[10]: https://www.audible.com/pd/The-New-Jim-Crow-Audiobook/B007QW236E\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8\n[12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Stevenson\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O7BMa9XGXE\n[14]: https://www.ted.com/speakers/kandace_sumner\n[15]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE\n[16]: https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/\n[17]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8\n[18]: https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html\n[19]: https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/a-school-under-metro-bridge-teaches-these-delhi-slum-children/story-Qr3EV279SarAME4K6N8orL.html",
