    <h2>Live Deliberately</h2>
  </header>
  <p>I beg the youngest of you, to arrange your life in such a way so that each<br>challenge before you, is the hardest thing you have ever done.</p>
  <p>To paraphrase Thoreau: I beg you to live and grow up deliberately, to front<br>only the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to teach,<br>and not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend, had. not.<br>yet. lived.</p>
  <p>Life is not random, it is not an accident, you are an emergent plateau in<br>an infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting contributions<br>are necessary.</p>

  <p>Humanity must break away from the circles. Progress in the larger world,<br>begins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, “I am not<br>smart enough”, “I am not a hero”, “I will never be heard”, “I will never be<br>enough”, “Too Scary!”. That is how every hero begun, by measuring up; and<br>then by growing up to the challenges before us.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I hope we will commit ourselves to building a human rights movement to end<br>mass incarceration. A movement for education, not incarceration. A movement<br>for jobs, not jails, and a movement to end all those forms of legal<br>discrimination against people released from prison. Discrimination denying<br>them basic human rights to work, to shelter, and to food.</p>

    <h2>The Walkouts</h2>
  </header>
  <p>December 10th, is <a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/">The Human Rights Day</a> and yet again, the hopelessness<br>turns to hope as we are granted a globally recognized focal point, and an<br>opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
  <p>When this nation is ready, December 10th will become the walkout day. For<br>District Judges, their staff, Attorneys, their assistants, for Bad Cops,<br>Good Police Officers, and their COs. On their mind will be the thought,<br>that to create a life long, legal, discrimination against an individual, is<br>a Human Rights violation. It should be impossible to ask the legal<br>community to follow the rule of law in the short term, and violate Human<br>Rights in the long run.</p>

    <h2>Poverty of Mind</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Poverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that<br>opposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.<br>Can we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would likely<br>not commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty? Every child<br>has a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons, Astrophysics -<br>goodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astrobiology. But poverty is<br>extremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in it self, but in<br>the surrounding culture that it frequently creates. Poverty is a virus<br>armed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia, violence, and dark<br>blind stupidity.</p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Some years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander<br>put us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many<br>more things right.</p>
  <p>In great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise your<br>children, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the<br>wall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up<br>high enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,<br>is not optional.</p>
  <p>My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is<br>null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal<br>Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and<br>void. We are one family, one people.</p>
  <p>I ask you to build homes with the belief that <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html">the inherent dignity and<br>equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the<br>foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world</a>, because<br>our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity.</p>

  <p>By rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes,<br>of great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world<br>forever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.</p>
  <p>The job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the<br>way up.</p>
  <p>All the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one<br>place where we can each share in them, where every member of the human<br>family can Converge on Wisdom.</p>
