Live Deliberately
-----------------

I beg the youngest of you, to arrange your life in such a way so that each  
challenge before you, is the hardest thing you have ever done.

To paraphrase Thoreau: I beg you to live and grow up deliberately, to front  
only the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to teach,  
and not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend, had. not.  
yet. lived.

Life is not random, it is not an accident, you are an emergent plateau in  
an infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting contributions  
are necessary.

Growing Up
----------

Humanity must break away from the circles. Progress in the larger world,  
begins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, “I am not  
smart enough”, “I am not a hero”, “I will never be heard”, “I will never be  
enough”, “Too Scary!”. That is how every hero begun, by measuring up; and  
then by growing up to the challenges before us.

New Voices
----------

The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://librivox.org/the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights-by-the-united-nations/) needs work, each generation  
needs to update it and extend it beyond what it is today, grant it new  
voices - and there are bright new voices to be heard.

Never Silenced
--------------

And there are voices that never stopped, fell out of the modern spotlight,  
but were never silenced, and never tired. No more circles.

Kandice Sumner's Prevention
---------------------------

[Kandice Sumner's](https://www.ted.com/speakers/kandace_sumner) idea beyond share & donate, is **prevention**. She sees young children asking powerful questions. She is trying to help them inherit wisdom from books, stories, history, and push them away from poverty.

Heroes Lost
-----------

It is heartbreaking that videos like “Don’t Talk to the Police” must exist.  
A Police Officer must also be a Hero, a force of Goodness. Any compromise  
between good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil.

The Walkouts
------------

December 10th, is [The Human Rights Day](https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/) and yet again, the hopelessness  
turns to hope as we are granted a globally recognized focal point, and an  
opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants.

When this nation is ready, December 10th will become the walkout day. For  
District Judges, their staff, Attorneys, their assistants, for Bad Cops,  
Good Police Officers, and their COs. On their mind will be the thought,  
that to create a life long, legal, discrimination against an individual, is  
a Human Rights violation. It should be impossible to ask the legal  
community to follow the rule of law in the short term, and violate Human  
Rights in the long run.

Poverty of Mind
---------------

Poverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that  
opposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.  
Can we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would likely  
not commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty? Every child  
has a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons, Astrophysics -  
goodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astrobiology. But poverty is  
extremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in it self, but in  
the surrounding culture that it frequently creates. Poverty is a virus  
armed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia, violence, and dark  
blind stupidity.

The Challenge
-------------

Some years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander  
put us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many  
more things right.

In great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise your  
children, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the  
wall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up  
high enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,  
is not optional.

My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is  
null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal  
Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and  
void. We are one family, one people.

I ask you to build homes with the belief that [the inherent dignity and  
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the  
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html), because  
our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity.

The Hero and The Runaway
------------------------

![The Hero and The Runaway](/image/the-runaway.jpg)

We'll put things right, we'll fix it all.

Heroism
-------

Don’t be frightened of becoming a hero. It is always the longest possible  
way there, and it is always on the shoulders of giants, my friends.

By rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes,  
of great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world  
forever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.

The job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the  
way up.

All the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one  
place where we can each share in them, where every member of the human  
family can Converge on Wisdom.

World Crisis
------------

![World Crisis](/image/school.png)

The human family is not divided by political borders. Kandice’s kids aren’t  
the only kids that need help. This is not just a national crisis, it is a  
global one.
