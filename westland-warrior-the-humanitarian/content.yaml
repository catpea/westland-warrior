    I beg the youngest of you, to arrange your life in such a way so that each
    challenge before you, is the hardest thing you have ever done.

    To paraphrase Thoreau: I beg you to live and grow up deliberately, to front
    only the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to teach,
    and not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend, had. not.
    yet. lived.

    Life is not random, it is not an accident, you are an emergent plateau in
    an infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting contributions
    are necessary.

    Humanity must break away from the circles. Progress in the larger world,
    begins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, “I am not
    smart enough”, “I am not a hero”, “I will never be heard”, “I will never be
    enough”, “Too Scary!”. That is how every hero begun, by measuring up; and
    then by growing up to the challenges before us.

    I hope we will commit ourselves to building a human rights movement to end
    mass incarceration. A movement for education, not incarceration. A movement
    for jobs, not jails, and a movement to end all those forms of legal
    discrimination against people released from prison. Discrimination denying
    them basic human rights to work, to shelter, and to food.

  title: The Walkouts
  text: |-
    December 10th, is [The Human Rights Day][1] and yet again, the hopelessness
    turns to hope as we are granted a globally recognized focal point, and an
    opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants.

    When this nation is ready, December 10th will become the walkout day. For
    District Judges, their staff, Attorneys, their assistants, for Bad Cops,
    Good Police Officers, and their COs. On their mind will be the thought,
    that to create a life long, legal, discrimination against an individual, is
    a Human Rights violation. It should be impossible to ask the legal
    community to follow the rule of law in the short term, and violate Human
    Rights in the long run.

  text: |-
    Poverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that
    opposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.
    Can we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would likely
    not commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty? Every child
    has a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons, Astrophysics -
    goodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astrobiology. But poverty is
    extremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in it self, but in
    the surrounding culture that it frequently creates. Poverty is a virus
    armed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia, violence, and dark
    blind stupidity.

  title: The Challenge
  text: |-
    Some years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander
    put us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many
    more things right.

    In great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise your
    children, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the
    wall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up
    high enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,
    is not optional.

    My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is
    null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal
    Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and
    void. We are one family, one people.

    I ask you to build homes with the belief that [the inherent dignity and
    equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the
    foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world][1], because
    our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity.

    Don’t be frightened of becoming a hero. It is always the longest possible
    way there, and it is always on the shoulders of giants, my friends.

    By rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes,
    of great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world
    forever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.

    The job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the
    way up.

    All the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one
    place where we can each share in them, where every member of the human
    family can Converge on Wisdom.
