QUOTE BY ROBERT ARDREY

> But we were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed killers besides.
> 
> And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles,
> and our irreconcilable regiments?
> 
> Or our treaties whatever they may be worth;
> our symphonies however seldom they may be played;
> our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields;
> our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.
> 
> The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen.
> 
> We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses.
> 
> Robert Ardrey[6]
