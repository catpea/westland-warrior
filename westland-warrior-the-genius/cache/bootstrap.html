      <p>One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: The
        English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication.</p>
      <p>The &quot;Double U&quot;, the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet
        has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the
        comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?</p>
      <p>Rhymes.</p>
      <p>Poems.</p>
      <p>Songs.</p>
      <p>Letters.</p>
      <p>Essays.</p>
      <p>Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades,

      <p>Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like
        Storytelling, for example.</p>
      <p>You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings,
        now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, and
        Faster Than Light Travel.</p>
      <p>You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted
        objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on
        a message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will mark
        forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it
        alive across centuries even as English evolves.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means
        progressive, gradual learning and mastery.</p>
      <p>It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words
        without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here &quot;The English
        Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication&quot; bonds really well with
        our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human
        learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it
        would still be a functional, but very different language.</p>
      <p>Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive
        adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn
        something, it won&#39;t be learned.</p>
      <p>But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously
        had trouble with it. For example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Created_the_Integers">God Created the Integers: The
          Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History</a> Stephen Hawking helped
        his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I
        view the book as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">Memory Palace</a> with emphasis on historical dates and
        progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the
        reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.</p>

      <p>Do you remember memorizing πr²?</p>
      <p>Forcing memorization of πr² or any formula, should be seen as psychological
        torture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspension
        of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made.</p>
      <p>Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English without
        the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel.</p>
      <p>Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can&#39;t comprehend πr², and her mind
        rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is
        squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there
        a geometric square somehow?</p>
      <p>Warm, but not warm enough.</p>
      <p>A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forced
        to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.</p>
      <p>People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural
        predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally
        predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not
        to, learn Mathematics, or be punished.</p>

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when
        compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of
        programming.</p>
      <p>Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in
        mathematics.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a></p>
      <p>It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for
        paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a> notes
        &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,
        context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).&quot;</p>
      <p>It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton
        from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to
        waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.</p>
      <p>Let us face that today&#39;s &quot;Alphabet of Math&quot; is basic Programming. This is
        because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to
        latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn
        out to be to you now.</p>
      <p>As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge
        come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">P5js</a> or
        maybe <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, or even <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> (keep it in sync with leading Web
        Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming,
        exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment
        opportunities).</p>
      <p>Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life
        when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games,
        visualizations.</p>

      <p>In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic
        calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates
        rectangles with a base twice the height.</p>
      <p>For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull them
        into the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology.</p>

      <p>Study your Frameworks.</p>
      <p>Generations have tried to avoid Genius, and the World is hurting for it.</p>
      <p>We are bound to this planet, chemically, biologically, even intellectually.</p>
      <p>We are all connected.</p>
      <p>There is no moving to Mars.</p>
      <p>And we were never allowed to let the TV, or the talking-heads, or lairs, do
        the talking - with each new generation, doubly so.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Memorization is Over</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Tell your teacher that memorization is over, it is useless to you.</p>
      <p>Tell your teachers that they are not allowed to stand in your way of real
        knowledge.</p>
      <p>They are interrupting your real education by threatening to mark you down
        for not following their worthless directions which can only lead to
        memorization, which in turn will soon result in you forgetting what you
        force-remembered.</p>
      <p>It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way you
        did it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken
        advantage of. The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, school
        qualifying for more funding.</p>
      <p>GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people will
        easily mislead you. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy">Vaccine Hesitancy</a> which a lot of
        people fall for, but there are more complicated and closer calls like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion">CFCs</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE2uwBA3EAw">Tetraethyl Lead</a>, and now <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22116696">PFAS</a>. You need to be
        knowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don&#39;t
        count on the adults, they&#39;re all going to retire of old age soon enough.</p>
      <p>Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on
        everything from internal decision making, to external politics of the whole
        World.</p>
      <p>The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and you
        will become the future.</p>
      <p>Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way.</p>
      <p>You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books.</p>
      <p>Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot.</p>
