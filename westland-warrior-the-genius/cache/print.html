  <div class="paragraph">Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like
    Storytelling, for example.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings,

    Faster Than Light Travel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted
    objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on
    a message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will mark
    forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it
    alive across centuries even as English evolves.</div>

    <h2>Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means
    progressive, gradual learning and mastery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words
    without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here "The English
    Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication" bonds really well with
    our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human
    learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it
    would still be a functional, but very different language.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive
    adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn
    something, it won't be learned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously
    had trouble with it. For example in <span>God Created the Integers: The
      Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History<sup>[14]</sup></span> Stephen Hawking helped
    his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I
    view the book as a <span>Memory Palace<sup>[15]</sup></span> with emphasis on historical dates and
    progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the
    reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.</div>

    <h2>Memorizing πr²</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Do you remember memorizing πr²?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Forcing memorization of πr² or any formula, should be seen as psychological
    torture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspension
    of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English without
    the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can't comprehend πr², and her mind
    rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is
    squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there
    a geometric square somehow?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Warm, but not warm enough.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forced
    to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural
    predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally
    predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not
    to, learn Mathematics, or be punished.</div>

    <h2>Math</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when
    compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of
    programming.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in
    mathematics.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Math as Code<sup>[24]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for
    paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As <span>Math as Code<sup>[25]</sup></span> notes
    "Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,
    context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc)."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton
    from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to
    waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us face that today's "Alphabet of Math" is basic Programming. This is
    because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to
    latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn
    out to be to you now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge
    come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like <span>P5js<sup>[26]</sup></span> or
    maybe <span>D3<sup>[27]</sup></span>, or even <span>SVG<sup>[28]</sup></span> (keep it in sync with leading Web
    Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming,
    exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment
    opportunities).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life
    when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games,
    visualizations.</div>
