You are a Genius.

Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks.
One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: TheEnglish Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication.
The "Double U", the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabethas extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then thecomma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?
Rhymes.
Poems.
Songs.
Letters.
Essays.
Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades,parents?
Memorizing Poems?
Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did.
Speaking. Reading. Writing.

Thorgal

Frameworks are superpowers, and your powers will call to you.

Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, likeStorytelling, for example.
You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings,now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, andFaster Than Light Travel.
You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchantedobjects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass ona message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will markforks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep italive across centuries even as English evolves.

Story of Beowulf

Land of Monsters?

My friends, the story of Grendles Mōdor remains unfinished, IdesAglæcwif of Ælwihta Eard; beacons her side to be writ. Was Grendles Modor amonster, would she be an Ide then?
Was the Dragon a mere reminder, a clumsy blurb for Memento Mori or isthat just the introduction to the real story, the story that has little todo with men like Beowulf who can't even take down a fat flying lizardright. A story burned to the ground by the spirit of the age, the GreatestStory Never Told, The Story of The Ides of the Old World.
Pick up the pen. Rebuild the story a thousand times, and let the version1001 earn you a place in history.

The Dises (1909) by Dorothy Hardy.

A Pen is Mightier than a Sword.

Genius, is to answer the challenge. Ælwihta Eard, is the world of ourchildhood stories, from Baba Jaga, to The One Ring, to Harry Potter, andbeyond.
Genius is to pick up the pen, and not fear sounding foolish.

Do not deny your Readers

Do not deny your stories to those who are still learning the lessons youhave already mastered.
What if your "Not good enough", will become the best they ever had?
Mightier than The Sword.

Damn kids. They're all alike.

When I was learning English, my most powerful piece of literature was TheConscience of a Hacker, or The Hacker Manifesto. (See External Linkssection for Hacker's Manifesto at Phrack Magazine)
I am wiser now, the text is for a teenager. But I feel no shame for stillholding it dear to my heart. I am glad to share with you.

The Conscience of a Hacker

...
We explore... and you call us criminals.
We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.
We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias...and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us andtry to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

Damn kids. They're all alike.

These words are still as mighty as the day I found them.

The Conscience of a Hacker read by The Mentor

You are a Genius.

Because storytelling, inspiration, sharing of wisdom, is just a part of TheEnglish Framework for Human Communication - that you mastered withoutnoticing... as a child.
At the age of 15 or earlier, you master a framework almost as complex asany of the more interesting Daughters of Philosophy (The Sciences).
It comes to you so naturally, that you don't notice it.
You think we are born with the ability for language.
But, no.
And not only do you learn it, your brain grows to match the complexity ofinformation and tools needed to manipulate it.

Neuro Genesis: You can grow new brain cells. Here's how by Sandrine Thuret

Genius, like Child Prodigy, is just a stepping stone. Don't stop.

You are to surpass what you think Genius is, on your way up, to growing allthe way up.
This act of transcendence will recur several times, depending how busy youget in life.
Some things you think are one-way today; High School, Roswell,Globalization, Content of Character, Memorable Words, Superstars,Mokele-Mbembe, Spelling and Grammar (To use my teenage mind as example)will change meaning, as you grow; possibly/hopefully even reverse.
Similar to how "We make use of a service already existing without payingfor what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, andyou call us criminals." turns around, as we learn that CriminalPhreaking is just not worth the damn prison time.
My Dear, Friends, Readers. You have mastered English.
You have easily mastered something only a genius child prodigy could.
Didn't even notice it, English came so naturally, so simply - didn't it?
... and you say you are not a Genius?
Wow, just wow.

English is Complex

Let me give you a hint on you how Frameworks like these emerge evolveacross centuries.

A History of English Letters

Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding

Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It meansprogressive, gradual learning and mastery.
It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write wordswithout knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here "The EnglishFramework for Advanced Human to Human Communication" bonds really well withour ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with humanlearning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, itwould still be a functional, but very different language.
Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressiveadaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learnsomething, it won't be learned.
But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previouslyhad trouble with it. For example in God Created the Integers: TheMathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History Stephen Hawking helpedhis memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. Iview the book as a Memory Palace with emphasis on historical dates andprogression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps thereader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.

What if Schools Taught Us How to Learn by Jonathan Levi

Memorizing πr²

Do you remember memorizing πr²?
Forcing memorization of πr² or any formula, should be seen as psychologicaltorture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspensionof the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made.
Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English withoutthe use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel.
Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can't comprehend πr², and her mindrejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r issquared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is therea geometric square somehow?
Warm, but not warm enough.
A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forcedto merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.
People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the naturalpredisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturallypredisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, notto, learn Mathematics, or be punished.

Area of a circle, how to get the formula.

Just Eyeball

Just witness that half the circumference of the circle (4 slices) are usedat the the base of the rectangle, because the other four are used up top.It really does not matter how many divisions of the circle so as long asreaching infinity makes for an infinitely perfect rectangle ❤

The Framework is Mightier Than The Formula

Armed with this knowledge, our young lady, can arrive at her own πr², whenneeded.
But also at E=mc², and all the wonderful rest.
And so can you. My Genius Reader.

Genius Is Our Right

Genius is knowing the framework mechanics, and reinventing the formulas asneeded.
Sometimes, applying mechanics from one place by subtle analogy to another.
For example apply lessons from trains and their relativity of motion anddistortion of sound waves, to other things...

Simple Relativity - Understanding Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity

Einstein's Proof of E=mc2

Math

Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy whencompared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world ofprogramming.
Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things inmathematics.

It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant forpaper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As Math as Code notes"Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc)."
It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newtonfrom the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is towaste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.
Let us face that today's "Alphabet of Math" is basic Programming. This isbecause programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier tolatch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turnout to be to you now.
As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledgecome to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like P5js ormaybe D3, or even SVG (keep it in sync with leading WebTechnologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming,exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employmentopportunities).
Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to lifewhen transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games,visualizations.

Karlie Kloss explains how to use math with the artist in Code Studio

Easy as π

Look a the ease with which Karlie Kloss teaches real, live, moving,interactive, Modern Math to children.
It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like Math as Codechildren who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and AbstractMathematics. A child using the program that Karlie teaches with willsee little surface difference between making a rectangle and convertingmatter to energy via Einstein's E=mc². A venture into the functioncontents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, mayperhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet,both.
In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamiccalculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that createsrectangles with a base twice the height.
For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull theminto the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology.
Kode With Klossy shows what these classes are like. What real education looks like, where teachers strive to be worthy of teaching their students.

Frameworks: Why.

Genius.

Study your Frameworks.
Generations have tried to avoid Genius, and the World is hurting for it.
We are bound to this planet, chemically, biologically, even intellectually.
We are all connected.
There is no moving to Mars.
And we were never allowed to let the TV, or the talking-heads, or lairs, dothe talking - with each new generation, doubly so.

We are all connected.

Accept The Responsibility

People laugh off running out of water, but that's actually terribly simple.
It will happen like this: U.S. drinking water widely contaminated with'forever chemicals'
But remember, all problems created by Humans, can be solved by Humans too.

Those That Can't Do, Teach.

Memorization is Over

Tell your teacher that memorization is over, it is useless to you.
Tell your teachers that they are not allowed to stand in your way of realknowledge.
They are interrupting your real education by threatening to mark you downfor not following their worthless directions which can only lead tomemorization, which in turn will soon result in you forgetting what youforce-remembered.
It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way youdid it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being takenadvantage of. The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, schoolqualifying for more funding.
GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people willeasily mislead you. One example is Vaccine Hesitancy which a lot ofpeople fall for, but there are more complicated and closer calls likeCFCs and Tetraethyl Lead, and now PFAS. You need to beknowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in theworld.
Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don'tcount on the adults, they're all going to retire of old age soon enough.
Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact oneverything from internal decision making, to external politics of the wholeWorld.
The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and youwill become the future.
Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way.
You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books.
Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot.

Genius by Mark Diaz

The Future, The World

You were born a Genius. You are a Genius. It is not even that big of adeal, you are a human with a brain, Genius is what we do. On the other end,people saying they are better than you because they are a Genius, are sickfrom poverty of mind, they got fractured, stuck. It is sad, let us hopethey feel better and catch up, but pass them on as they heal.
Keep moving forward, keep learning, the World needs you to grow, to growall the way up, you, and all your peers, and all generations to come.
It is the journey of self education that makes the real difference.
Begin your journey under the banner of Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellenceand Love of Wisdom.
The Future, and The World, it will all be Yours.
You are far more than Genius.
Unbreakable.
Unstoppable.
Uncontainable.
Unpredictable.
Uncontrollable.
You Are The Future.
