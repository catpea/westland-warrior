  </header>
  <p>Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks.</p>
  <p>One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: The<br>English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication.</p>
  <p>The &quot;Double U&quot;, the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet<br>has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the<br>comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?</p>
  <p>Rhymes.</p>
  <p>Poems.</p>
  <p>Songs.</p>
  <p>Letters.</p>
  <p>Essays.</p>
  <p>Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades,<br>parents?</p>
  <p>Memorizing Poems?</p>
  <p>Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did.</p>
  <p>Speaking. Reading. Writing.</p>

    <h2>Frameworks are superpowers, and your powers will call to you.</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like<br>Storytelling, for example.</p>
  <p>You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings,<br>now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, and<br>Faster Than Light Travel.</p>
  <p>You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted<br>objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on<br>a message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will mark<br>forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it<br>alive across centuries even as English evolves.</p>

  <p>Because storytelling, inspiration, sharing of wisdom, is just a part of The<br>English Framework for Human Communication - that you mastered without<br>noticing... as a child.</p>
  <p>At the age of 15 or earlier, you master a framework almost as complex as<br>any of the more interesting Daughters of Philosophy (The Sciences).</p>
  <p>It comes to you so naturally, that you don&#39;t notice it.</p>
  <p>You think we are born with the ability for language.</p>
  <p>But, no.</p>

  <p>Some things you think are one-way today; High School, Roswell,<br>Globalization, Content of Character, Memorable Words, Superstars,<br>Mokele-Mbembe, Spelling and Grammar (To use my teenage mind as example)<br>will change meaning, as you grow; possibly/hopefully even reverse.</p>
  <p>Similar to how &quot;We make use of a service already existing without paying<br>for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn&#39;t run by profiteering gluttons, and<br>you call us criminals.&quot; turns around, as we learn that Criminal<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking">Phreaking</a> is just not worth the damn prison time.</p>

    <h2>Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means<br>progressive, gradual learning and mastery.</p>
  <p>It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words<br>without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here &quot;The English<br>Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication&quot; bonds really well with<br>our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human<br>learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it<br>would still be a functional, but very different language.</p>
  <p>Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive<br>adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn<br>something, it won&#39;t be learned.</p>
  <p>But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously<br>had trouble with it. For example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Created_the_Integers">God Created the Integers: The<br>Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History</a> Stephen Hawking helped<br>his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I<br>view the book as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">Memory Palace</a> with emphasis on historical dates and<br>progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the<br>reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.</p>

    <h2>Memorizing πr²</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Do you remember memorizing πr²?</p>
  <p>Forcing memorization of πr² or any formula, should be seen as psychological<br>torture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspension<br>of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made.</p>
  <p>Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English without<br>the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel.</p>
  <p>Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can&#39;t comprehend πr², and her mind<br>rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is<br>squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there<br>a geometric square somehow?</p>
  <p>Warm, but not warm enough.</p>
  <p>A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forced<br>to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.</p>
  <p>People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural<br>predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally<br>predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not<br>to, learn Mathematics, or be punished.</p>

    <h2>Math</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when<br>compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of<br>programming.</p>
  <p>Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in<br>mathematics.</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a></p>
  <p>It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for<br>paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a> notes<br>&quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,<br>context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).&quot;</p>
  <p>It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton<br>from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to<br>waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.</p>
  <p>Let us face that today&#39;s &quot;Alphabet of Math&quot; is basic Programming. This is<br>because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to<br>latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn<br>out to be to you now.</p>
  <p>As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge<br>come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">P5js</a> or<br>maybe <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, or even <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> (keep it in sync with leading Web<br>Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming,<br>exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment<br>opportunities).</p>
  <p>Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life<br>when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games,<br>visualizations.</p>

  <p>It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a><br>children who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and Abstract<br>Mathematics. A child using the program that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language">Karlie teaches with</a> will<br>see little surface difference between making a rectangle and converting<br>matter to energy via Einstein&#39;s E=mc². A venture into the function<br>contents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, may<br>perhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet,<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light">both</a>.</p>
  <p>In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic<br>calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates<br>rectangles with a base twice the height.</p>
  <p>For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull them<br>into the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/">Kode With Klossy</a> shows what these classes are like. What real education looks like, where teachers strive to be worthy of teaching their students.</p>

    <h2>Memorization is Over</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Tell your teacher that memorization is over, it is useless to you.</p>
  <p>Tell your teachers that they are not allowed to stand in your way of real<br>knowledge.</p>
  <p>They are interrupting your real education by threatening to mark you down<br>for not following their worthless directions which can only lead to<br>memorization, which in turn will soon result in you forgetting what you<br>force-remembered.</p>
  <p>It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way you<br>did it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken<br>advantage of. The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, school<br>qualifying for more funding.</p>
  <p>GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people will<br>easily mislead you. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy">Vaccine Hesitancy</a> which a lot of<br>people fall for, but there are more complicated and closer calls like<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion">CFCs</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE2uwBA3EAw">Tetraethyl Lead</a>, and now <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22116696">PFAS</a>. You need to be<br>knowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in the<br>world.</p>
  <p>Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don&#39;t<br>count on the adults, they&#39;re all going to retire of old age soon enough.</p>
  <p>Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on<br>everything from internal decision making, to external politics of the whole<br>World.</p>
  <p>The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and you<br>will become the future.</p>
  <p>Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way.</p>
  <p>You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books.</p>
  <p>Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot.</p>

    <h2>The Future, The World</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You were born a Genius. You are a Genius. It is not even that big of a<br>deal, you are a human with a brain, Genius is what we do. On the other end,<br>people saying they are better than you because they are a Genius, are sick<br>from poverty of mind, they got fractured, stuck. It is sad, let us hope<br>they feel better and catch up, but pass them on as they heal.</p>
  <p>Keep moving forward, keep learning, the World needs you to grow, to grow<br>all the way up, you, and all your peers, and all generations to come.</p>
  <p>It is the journey of self education that makes the real difference.</p>
  <p>Begin your journey under the banner of Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence<br>and Love of Wisdom.</p>
  <p>The Future, and The World, it will all be Yours.</p>
  <p>You are far more than Genius.</p>
  <p>Unbreakable.</p>
  <p>Unstoppable.</p>
  <p>Uncontainable.</p>
  <p>Unpredictable.</p>
  <p>Uncontrollable.</p>
  <p>You Are The Future.</p>
