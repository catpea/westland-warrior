    Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks.

    One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: The
    English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication.

    The "Double U", the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet
    has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the
    comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?

    Rhymes.

    Poems.

    Songs.

    Letters.

    Essays.

    Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades,
    parents?

    Memorizing Poems?

    Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did.

    Speaking. Reading. Writing.

  text: |-
    Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like
    Storytelling, for example.

    You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings,
    now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, and
    Faster Than Light Travel.

    You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted
    objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on
    a message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will mark
    forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it
    alive across centuries even as English evolves.

    My friends, the story of [Grendles Mōdor][1] remains unfinished, [Ides][2]
    Aglæcwif of Ælwihta Eard; beacons her side to be writ. Was Grendles Modor a
    monster, would she be an Ide then?

    Was the Dragon a mere reminder, a clumsy blurb for [Memento Mori][3] or is
    that just the introduction to the real story, the story that has little to
    do with men like Beowulf who can't even take down a fat flying lizard
    right. A story burned to the ground by the spirit of the age, the Greatest
    Story Never Told, The Story of The Ides of the Old World.

    Pick up the pen. Rebuild the story a thousand times, and let the version
    1001 earn you a place in history.

    Because storytelling, inspiration, sharing of wisdom, is just a part of The
    English Framework for Human Communication - that you mastered without
    noticing... as a child.

    At the age of 15 or earlier, you master a framework almost as complex as
    any of the more interesting Daughters of Philosophy (The Sciences).

    It comes to you so naturally, that you don't notice it.

    You think we are born with the ability for language.

    But, no.

    And not only do you learn it, your brain grows to match the complexity of
    information and tools needed to manipulate it.

    Mokele-Mbembe, Spelling and Grammar (To use my teenage mind as example)
    will change meaning, as you grow; possibly/hopefully even reverse.

    Similar to how "We make use of a service already existing without paying
    for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
    you call us criminals." turns around, as we learn that Criminal
    [Phreaking][1] is just not worth the damn prison time.

    My Dear, Friends, Readers. You have mastered English.

    You have easily mastered something only a genius child prodigy could.

    Didn't even notice it, English came so naturally, so simply - didn't it?

  title: Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding
  text: |-
    Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means
    progressive, gradual learning and mastery.

    It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words
    without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here "The English
    Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication" bonds really well with
    our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human
    learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it
    would still be a functional, but very different language.

    Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive
    adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn
    something, it won't be learned.

    But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously
    had trouble with it. For example in [God Created the Integers: The
    Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History][1] Stephen Hawking helped
    his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I
    view the book as a [Memory Palace][2] with emphasis on historical dates and
    progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the
    reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.

  title: Memorizing πr²
  text: |-
    Do you remember memorizing πr²?

    Forcing memorization of πr² or any formula, should be seen as psychological
    torture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspension
    of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made.

    Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English without
    the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel.

    Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can't comprehend πr², and her mind
    rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is
    squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there
    a geometric square somehow?

    Warm, but not warm enough.

    A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forced
    to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.

    People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural
    predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally
    predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not
    to, learn Mathematics, or be punished.

    Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when
    compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of
    programming.

    Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in
    mathematics.

    [Math as Code][1]

    It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for
    paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As [Math as Code][2] notes
    "Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,
    context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc)."

    It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton
    from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to
    waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.

    Let us face that today's "Alphabet of Math" is basic Programming. This is
    because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to
    latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn
    out to be to you now.

    As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge
    come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like [P5js][3] or
    maybe [D3][4], or even [SVG][5] (keep it in sync with leading Web
    Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming,
    exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment
    opportunities).

    Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life
    when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games,
    visualizations.

    It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like [Math as Code][1]
    children who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and Abstract
    Mathematics. A child using the program that [Karlie teaches with][2] will
    see little surface difference between making a rectangle and converting
    matter to energy via Einstein's E=mc². A venture into the function
    contents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, may
    perhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet,
    [both][3].

    In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic
    calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates
    rectangles with a base twice the height.

    For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull them
    into the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology.

    Tell your teacher that memorization is over, it is useless to you.

    Tell your teachers that they are not allowed to stand in your way of real
    knowledge.

    They are interrupting your real education by threatening to mark you down
    for not following their worthless directions which can only lead to
    memorization, which in turn will soon result in you forgetting what you
    force-remembered.

    It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way you
    did it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken
    advantage of. The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, school
    qualifying for more funding.

    GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people will
    easily mislead you. One example is [Vaccine Hesitancy][1] which a lot of
    people fall for, but there are more complicated and closer calls like
    [CFCs][2] and [Tetraethyl Lead][3], and now [PFAS][4]. You need to be
    knowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in the
    world.

    Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don't
    count on the adults, they're all going to retire of old age soon enough.

    Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on
    everything from internal decision making, to external politics of the whole
    World.

    The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and you
    will become the future.

    Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way.

    You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books.

    Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot.
