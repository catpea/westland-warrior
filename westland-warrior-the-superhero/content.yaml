  title: The three secrets of resilient people by Lucy Hone
- type: quote
  author: Lucy Hone
  text: |-
    "Number One: Resilient people get that \[terrible disasters do happen\],
    they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn't mean they actually
    welcome it \[...\] just that when the tough times come they seem to know
    that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you
    from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come."

    "Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where
    they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising
    situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can
    change, and somehow accept the things that they can't."

    "Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what's good in
    your world."

    "Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves "Is what I'm doing helping
    or harming me?" this is a question that's used a lot in good therapy."

    "Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?"

    decision making.

    Dan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a character,
    next to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short. Dan is someone who
    quite literally pulled him self up by his own shoe laces.

    Here is [Way of the Peaceful Warrior Audiobook][1] narrated by the man
    himself. It was also made into a movie starring Nick Nolte as Soc.

  title: By Whatever Means
  text: |-
    By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going
    forward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beings
    that we once thought the adults already were.

    Reaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence is
    not optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face those
    circles again.

    A warrior is not about perfection. Or invulnerability. He is about absolute
    vulnerability. That’s the only true courage.

    The mighty Brené Brown further elucidates on the subject of vulnerability
    through what in my opinion is a two part TED talk: The power of
    vulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame.

  title: The Man in the Arena
  author: Theodore Roosevelt
  text: |-
    It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong
    man stumbles,

    or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

    The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,

    whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;

    who strives valiantly; who errs,

    who comes short again and again,

    because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;

    but who does actually strive to do the deeds;

    who knows great enthusiasms,

    the great devotions;

    who spends himself in a worthy cause;

    who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,

    and who at the worst,

    if he fails,

    at least fails while daring greatly,

    so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who
    neither know victory nor defeat.

  text: |-
    Don’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and he
    is right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash.
    And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when
    you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by
    Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the
    culture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of
    giants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes
    checking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.

    Never give up, whatever your calling, never retreat, never surrender. And
    in the absence of teachers, you become the teacher. Sure, maybe [anything
    that can go wrong will go wrong][1] but that’s just the next challenge,
    your next level up. An opportunity to stand even taller.
