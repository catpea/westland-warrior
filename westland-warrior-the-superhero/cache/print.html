    <h2>Quote by Lucy Hone</h2>
  </header>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Number One: Resilient people get that [terrible disasters do happen],
      they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn't mean they actually
      welcome it [...] just that when the tough times come they seem to know
      that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you
      from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come."</p>
    <p>"Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where
      they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising
      situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can
      change, and somehow accept the things that they can't."</p>
    <p>"Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what's good in
      your world."</p>
    <p>"Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves "Is what I'm doing helping
      or harming me?" this is a question that's used a lot in good therapy."</p>
    <p>"Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?"</p>

    <h2>A Warrior in Training</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Dan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a character,
    next to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short. Dan is someone who
    quite literally pulled him self up by his own shoe laces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here is <span>Way of the Peaceful Warrior Audiobook<sup>[3]</sup></span> narrated by the man
    himself. It was also made into a movie starring Nick Nolte as Soc.</div>

    <h2>By Whatever Means</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going
    forward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beings
    that we once thought the adults already were.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Reaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence is
    not optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face those
    circles again.</div>

    <h2>The Man in the Arena</h2>
    <h3>Theodore Roosevelt</h3>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong
    man stumbles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who strives valiantly; who errs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who comes short again and again,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but who does actually strive to do the deeds;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who knows great enthusiasms,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the great devotions;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who spends himself in a worthy cause;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and who at the worst,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if he fails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at least fails while daring greatly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who
    neither know victory nor defeat.</div>

    <h2>Suit Up</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Put on the Superhero Suit and step into the arena, right now. Being ashamed
    to dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next challenge, are
    just illusions that are holding you back.</div>

    <h2>The Culture of Great Beings</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Don’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and he
    is right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash.
    And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when
    you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by
    Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the
    culture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of
    giants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes
    checking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.</div>
