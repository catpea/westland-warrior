The three secrets of resilient people by Lucy Hone

Quote by Lucy Hone

"Number One: Resilient people get that [terrible disasters do happen],they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn't mean they actuallywelcome it [...] just that when the tough times come they seem to knowthat suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops youfrom feeling discriminated against when the tough times come."
"Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully wherethey select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraisingsituations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they canchange, and somehow accept the things that they can't."
"Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what's good inyour world."
"Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves "Is what I'm doing helpingor harming me?" this is a question that's used a lot in good therapy."
"Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?"

No Retreat, No Surrender (1986)

By Whatever Means

By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep goingforward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beingsthat we once thought the adults already were.
Reaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence isnot optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face thosecircles again.

Dan Millman, teaches us to take out the trash, to erase doubt, negativity,fear, keep moving forward and become Vulnerable and Fearless Warriors.

Peaceful Warrior Quotes

Quote by Soc

A warrior is not about perfection. Or invulnerability. He is about absolutevulnerability. That’s the only true courage.

Soc

Vulnerability and Shame

The mighty Brené Brown further elucidates on the subject of vulnerabilitythrough what in my opinion is a two part TED talk: The power ofvulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame.

The power of vulnerability

Listening to shame

The Man in the Arena
Theodore Roosevelt

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strongman stumbles,
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
who strives valiantly; who errs,
who comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
who knows great enthusiasms,
the great devotions;
who spends himself in a worthy cause;
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
and who at the worst,
if he fails,
at least fails while daring greatly,
so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls whoneither know victory nor defeat.

Suit Up

Put on the Superhero Suit and step into the arena, right now. Being ashamedto dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next challenge, arejust illusions that are holding you back.
You are each to become a Great Being. The world needs Superheroes.

Become a Great Being

Be it fixing schools, or erasing borders, or just preventing Anthropocenefrom becoming an extinction event it will take a Great Being to beheard, Greta Thunberg is a wonderful example, today.

The Culture of Great Beings

Don’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and heis right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash.And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am whenyou are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook byBill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, theculture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders ofgiants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroeschecking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.

Good Nights

Rise!

Never give up, whatever your calling, never retreat, never surrender. Andin the absence of teachers, you become the teacher. Sure, maybe anythingthat can go wrong will go wrong but that’s just the next challenge,your next level up. An opportunity to stand even taller.

Best of Your Life

Come morning, it does not matter how old you are, or how many times youfailed already, the rest of your life is always ahead of you. Make therest of your life, the best of your life.

Make the rest of your life, the best of your life.
