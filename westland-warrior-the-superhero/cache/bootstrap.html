    Quote by Lucy Hone
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>&quot;Number One: Resilient people get that [terrible disasters do happen],
        they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn&#39;t mean they actually
        welcome it [...] just that when the tough times come they seem to know
        that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you
        from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where
        they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising
        situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can
        change, and somehow accept the things that they can&#39;t.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what&#39;s good in
        your world.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves &quot;Is what I&#39;m doing helping
        or harming me?&quot; this is a question that&#39;s used a lot in good therapy.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Is what I&#39;m doing helping or harming me?&quot;</p>

      <p>By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going

      <p>Don’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and he

        And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when
        you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by
        Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the
        culture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of
        giants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes
