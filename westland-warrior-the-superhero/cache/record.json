My friends.\n\nDan Millman's Ted Talk\n----------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-MDL85fzdc1g.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDL85fzdc1g)\n\nA Warrior in Training\n---------------------\n\nDan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a character,  \nnext to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short. Dan is someone who  \nquite literally pulled him self up by his own shoe laces.\n\nHere is [Way of the Peaceful Warrior Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Way-of-the-Peaceful-Warrior-Audiobook/B002UZKKSU) narrated by the man  \nhimself. It was also made into a movie starring Nick Nolte as Soc.\n\nWay of the Peaceful Warrior Trailer\n-----------------------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-gegNMYvY_yg.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gegNMYvY_yg)\n\nSensei Lee\n----------\n\nThere is a similar theme in No retreat No surrender, where the boy calls  \nupon Sensei Lee, to come an teach him.\n\nNo Retreat, No Surrender (1986)\n-------------------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-Op4g9McS3EY.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op4g9McS3EY)\n\nBy Whatever Means\n-----------------\n\nBy whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going  \nforward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beings  \nthat we once thought the adults already were.\n\nReaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence is  \nnot optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face those  \ncircles again.\n\nAnother Mad World\n-----------------\n\n[![](/image/yid--YFbxFq6Zr8.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YFbxFq6Zr8)\n\nTake Out The Trash\n------------------\n\nDan Millman, teaches us to take out the trash, to erase doubt, negativity,  \nfear, keep moving forward and become Vulnerable and Fearless Warriors.\n\nPeaceful Warrior Quotes\n-----------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-31lUwuhE8pc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31lUwuhE8pc)\n\nQuote by Soc\n------------\n\n> A warrior is not about perfection. Or invulnerability. He is about absolute  \n> vulnerability. That’s the only true courage.\n> \n> \\-- Soc\n\nVulnerability and Shame\n-----------------------\n\nThe mighty Brené Brown further elucidates on the subject of vulnerability  \nthrough what in my opinion is a two part TED talk: The power of  \nvulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame.\n\nThe power of vulnerability\n--------------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-iCvmsMzlF7o.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o)\n\nListening to shame\n------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-psN1DORYYV0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0)\n\nThe Man in the Arena by Theodore Roosevelt\n------------------------------------------\n\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong  \nman stumbles,\n\nor where the doer of deeds could have done them better.\n\nThe credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,\n\nwhose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;\n\nwho strives valiantly; who errs,\n\nwho comes short again and again,\n\nbecause there is no effort without error and shortcoming;\n\nbut who does actually strive to do the deeds;\n\nwho knows great enthusiasms,\n\nthe great devotions;\n\nwho spends himself in a worthy cause;\n\nwho at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,\n\nand who at the worst,\n\nif he fails,\n\nat least fails while daring greatly,\n\nso that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who  \nneither know victory nor defeat.\n\nSuit Up\n-------\n\nPut on the Superhero Suit and step into the arena, right now. Being ashamed  \nto dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next challenge, are  \njust illusions that are holding you back.\n\nYou are each to become a Great Being. The world needs Superheroes.\n\nBecome a Great Being\n--------------------\n\nBe it fixing schools, or erasing borders, or just preventing Anthropocene  \nfrom becoming an [extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) it will take a Great Being to be  \nheard, Greta Thunberg is a wonderful example, today.\n\nGreta Thunberg\n--------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-TMrtLsQbaok.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrtLsQbaok)\n\nThey are Everywhere and Everywhen\n---------------------------------\n\nErica Goldson carries on her message and self-education, aiming to inspire  \nand help the world grow. She discovered the absence of teachers early on,  \nand immediately became an educator her self.\n\nErica Goldson Valedictorian Speech\n----------------------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-9M4tdMsg3ts.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts)\n\nErica Goldson Self Education\n----------------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-hgui64Kr0Go.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgui64Kr0Go)\n\nThe Culture of Great Beings\n---------------------------\n\nDon’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and he  \nis right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash.  \nAnd, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when  \nyou are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by  \nBill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the  \nculture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of  \ngiants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes  \nchecking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.\n\nGood Nights\n-----------\n\n[A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW)\n\n[A Walk in the Woods, Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Walk-in-the-Woods-Audiobook/B0091J9AQQ)\n\n[I’m a Stranger Here Myself, Notes on Returning to America After 20 Years Away](https://www.audible.com/pd/Im-a-Stranger-Here-Myself-Audiobook/B002V5BQJQ)\n\n[The Demon-Haunted World, Science as a Candle in the Dark](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Audiobook/B06XTZZLZ8)\n\n[Assassination Vacation](https://www.audible.com/pd/Assassination-Vacation-Audiobook/B002V8N0VK)\n\nRise!\n-----\n\nNever give up, whatever your calling, never retreat, never surrender. And  \nin the absence of teachers, you become the teacher. Sure, maybe [anything  \nthat can go wrong will go wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) but that’s just the next challenge,  \nyour next level up. An opportunity to stand even taller.\n\nBest of Your Life\n-----------------\n\nCome morning, it does not matter how old you are, or how many times you  \nfailed already, the rest of your life is always ahead of you. **Make the  \nrest of your life, the best of your life.**\n\nMake the rest of your life, the best of your life.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n[![](/image/yid-FhzNSPiqO0M.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhzNSPiqO0M)",

  "text": "The three secrets of resilient people by Lucy Hone[1]\n\nQUOTE BY LUCY HONE\n\n> \"Number One: Resilient people get that [terrible disasters do happen],\n> they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn't mean they actually\n> welcome it [...] just that when the tough times come they seem to know\n> that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you\n> from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come.\"\n> \n> \"Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where\n> they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising\n> situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can\n> change, and somehow accept the things that they can't.\"\n> \n> \"Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what's good in\n> your world.\"\n> \n> \"Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves \"Is what I'm doing helping\n> or harming me?\" this is a question that's used a lot in good therapy.\"\n> \n> \"Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?\"\n> \n> Lucy Hone\n\nQUO VADIS?\n\nPlease note that monitoring where each of your steps is taking you, whether\nit is good or bad for you, will help you navigate life and improve your\ndecision making.\nQuo Vadis? My friends.\nDan Millman's Ted Talk[2]\n\nA WARRIOR IN TRAINING\n\nDan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a character,\nnext to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short. Dan is someone who\nquite literally pulled him self up by his own shoe laces.\nHere is Way of the Peaceful Warrior Audiobook[3] narrated by the man\nhimself. It was also made into a movie starring Nick Nolte as Soc.\nWay of the Peaceful Warrior Trailer[4]\n\nSENSEI LEE\n\nThere is a similar theme in No retreat No surrender, where the boy calls\nupon Sensei Lee, to come an teach him.\nNo Retreat, No Surrender (1986)[5]\n\nBY WHATEVER MEANS\n\nBy whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going\nforward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beings\nthat we once thought the adults already were.\nReaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence is\nnot optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face those\ncircles again.\nAnother Mad World[6]\n\nTAKE OUT THE TRASH\n\nDan Millman, teaches us to take out the trash, to erase doubt, negativity,\nfear, keep moving forward and become Vulnerable and Fearless Warriors.\nPeaceful Warrior Quotes[7]\n\nQUOTE BY SOC\n\n> A warrior is not about perfection. Or invulnerability. He is about absolute\n> vulnerability. That’s the only true courage.\n> \n> Soc\n\nVULNERABILITY AND SHAME\n\nThe mighty Brené Brown further elucidates on the subject of vulnerability\nthrough what in my opinion is a two part TED talk: The power of\nvulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame.\nThe power of vulnerability[8]\nListening to shame[9]\n\nTHE MAN IN THE ARENA\n\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT\n\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong\nman stumbles,\nor where the doer of deeds could have done them better.\nThe credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,\nwhose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;\nwho strives valiantly; who errs,\nwho comes short again and again,\nbecause there is no effort without error and shortcoming;\nbut who does actually strive to do the deeds;\nwho knows great enthusiasms,\nthe great devotions;\nwho spends himself in a worthy cause;\nwho at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,\nand who at the worst,\nif he fails,\nat least fails while daring greatly,\nso that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who\nneither know victory nor defeat.\n\nSUIT UP\n\nPut on the Superhero Suit and step into the arena, right now. Being ashamed\nto dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next challenge, are\njust illusions that are holding you back.\nYou are each to become a Great Being. The world needs Superheroes.\n\nBECOME A GREAT BEING\n\nBe it fixing schools, or erasing borders, or just preventing Anthropocene\nfrom becoming an extinction event[10] it will take a Great Being to be\nheard, Greta Thunberg is a wonderful example, today.\nGreta Thunberg[11]\n\nTHEY ARE EVERYWHERE AND EVERYWHEN\n\nErica Goldson carries on her message and self-education, aiming to inspire\nand help the world grow. She discovered the absence of teachers early on,\nand immediately became an educator her self.\nErica Goldson Valedictorian Speech[12]\nErica Goldson Self Education[13]\n\nTHE CULTURE OF GREAT BEINGS\n\nDon’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and he\nis right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash.\nAnd, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when\nyou are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by\nBill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the\nculture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of\ngiants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes\nchecking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.\n\nGOOD NIGHTS\n\nA Short History of Nearly Everything[14]\nA Walk in the Woods, Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail[15]\nI’m a Stranger Here Myself, Notes on Returning to America After 20 Years Away[16]\nThe Demon-Haunted World, Science as a Candle in the Dark[17]\nAssassination Vacation[18]\n\nRISE!\n\nNever give up, whatever your calling, never retreat, never surrender. And\nin the absence of teachers, you become the teacher. Sure, maybe anythingthat can go wrong will go wrong[19] but that’s just the next challenge,\nyour next level up. An opportunity to stand even taller.\n\nBEST OF YOUR LIFE\n\nCome morning, it does not matter how old you are, or how many times you\nfailed already, the rest of your life is always ahead of you. Make the\nrest of your life, the best of your life.\nMake the rest of your life, the best of your life.[20]\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWH8N-BvhAw\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDL85fzdc1g\n[3]: https://www.audible.com/pd/Way-of-the-Peaceful-Warrior-Audiobook/B002UZKKSU\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gegNMYvY_yg\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op4g9McS3EY\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YFbxFq6Zr8\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31lUwuhE8pc\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0\n[10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrtLsQbaok\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgui64Kr0Go\n[14]: https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW\n[15]: https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Walk-in-the-Woods-Audiobook/B0091J9AQQ\n[16]: https://www.audible.com/pd/Im-a-Stranger-Here-Myself-Audiobook/B002V5BQJQ\n[17]: https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Audiobook/B06XTZZLZ8\n[18]: https://www.audible.com/pd/Assassination-Vacation-Audiobook/B002V8N0VK\n[19]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law\n[20]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhzNSPiqO0M",
