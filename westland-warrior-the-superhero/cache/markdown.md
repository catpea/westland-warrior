Quote by Lucy Hone
------------------

> "Number One: Resilient people get that \[terrible disasters do happen\],  
> they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn't mean they actually  
> welcome it \[...\] just that when the tough times come they seem to know  
> that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you  
> from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come."
> 
> "Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where  
> they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising  
> situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can  
> change, and somehow accept the things that they can't."
> 
> "Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what's good in  
> your world."
> 
> "Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves "Is what I'm doing helping  
> or harming me?" this is a question that's used a lot in good therapy."
> 
> "Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?"

Please note that monitoring where each of your steps is taking you, whether  
it is good or bad for you, will help you navigate life and improve your  
decision making.

Quo Vadis? My friends.

Dan Millman's Ted Talk

A Warrior in Training
---------------------

Dan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a character,  
next to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short. Dan is someone who  
quite literally pulled him self up by his own shoe laces.

Here is [Way of the Peaceful Warrior Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Way-of-the-Peaceful-Warrior-Audiobook/B002UZKKSU) narrated by the man  
himself. It was also made into a movie starring Nick Nolte as Soc.

Sensei Lee
----------

There is a similar theme in No retreat No surrender, where the boy calls  
upon Sensei Lee, to come an teach him.

No Retreat, No Surrender (1986)

By Whatever Means
-----------------

By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going  
forward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beings  
that we once thought the adults already were.

Reaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence is  
not optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face those  
circles again.

Take Out The Trash
------------------

Dan Millman, teaches us to take out the trash, to erase doubt, negativity,  
fear, keep moving forward and become Vulnerable and Fearless Warriors.

Quote by Soc
------------

> A warrior is not about perfection. Or invulnerability. He is about absolute  
> vulnerability. That’s the only true courage.
> 
> \-- Soc

Vulnerability and Shame
-----------------------

The mighty Brené Brown further elucidates on the subject of vulnerability  
through what in my opinion is a two part TED talk: The power of  
vulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame.

The power of vulnerability

The Man in the Arena by Theodore Roosevelt
------------------------------------------

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong  
man stumbles,

or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,

whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;

who strives valiantly; who errs,

who comes short again and again,

because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;

but who does actually strive to do the deeds;

who knows great enthusiasms,

the great devotions;

who spends himself in a worthy cause;

who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,

and who at the worst,

if he fails,

at least fails while daring greatly,

so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who  
neither know victory nor defeat.

Suit Up
-------

Put on the Superhero Suit and step into the arena, right now. Being ashamed  
to dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next challenge, are  
just illusions that are holding you back.

You are each to become a Great Being. The world needs Superheroes.

Become a Great Being
--------------------

Be it fixing schools, or erasing borders, or just preventing Anthropocene  
from becoming an [extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) it will take a Great Being to be  
heard, Greta Thunberg is a wonderful example, today.

They are Everywhere and Everywhen
---------------------------------

Erica Goldson carries on her message and self-education, aiming to inspire  
and help the world grow. She discovered the absence of teachers early on,  
and immediately became an educator her self.

The Culture of Great Beings
---------------------------

Don’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and he  
is right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash.  
And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when  
you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by  
Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the  
culture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of  
giants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes  
checking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.

Rise!
-----

Never give up, whatever your calling, never retreat, never surrender. And  
in the absence of teachers, you become the teacher. Sure, maybe [anything  
that can go wrong will go wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) but that’s just the next challenge,  
your next level up. An opportunity to stand even taller.

Best of Your Life
-----------------

Come morning, it does not matter how old you are, or how many times you  
failed already, the rest of your life is always ahead of you. **Make the  
rest of your life, the best of your life.**

Make the rest of your life, the best of your life.
