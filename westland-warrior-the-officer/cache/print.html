    <h2>We The Warriors</h2>
    <h3></h3>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">We the warriors in pursuits of excellence, band together in sincerity and
    truth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May our philosophy be filled with power and may we connect in authenticity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we strengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clear
    thinking, and may our hatered of hypocrisy and pretence never diminish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we inspire each other in our endeavor to live above the common levels
    of life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we strengthen each other to choose the harder right instead of the
    easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth even if the whole
    can’t be won.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we endow each other with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is
    noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and
    knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we guard each other against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred
    things of life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we grant each other new ties of friendship and new opportunities for
    leadership or service.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we kindle our hearts in fellowship with those of a cheerful
    countenance, and soften our hearts with sympathy for those who sorrow and
    suffer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">May we help each other to maintain Honor untarnished and unsullied and to
    show forth in our lives the ideals we learned in doing our duty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All of which we ask in the names of those before us, of those who stand
    today, and those who are yet to rise.</div>

    <h2>Modern Day</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Here, we come to today, the modern times. In the battle between the
    Gentleman and The Officer. The Gentleman was lost. The honor code is no
    longer aimed at Men, it is now aimed at cadets, aimed away from the public.
    It almost seems like growing up is optional, and things get very strange in
    deed:</div>

    <h2>Modern Day</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">At times like these, where our greatest lessons are forgotten we must look
    back at where things got lost. At times like these the Knigtly Virtues ring
    again. As the poem says <em>The right can never die, If one man still recalls,
The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever
shines, If one heart holds it bright</em></div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think that one is <span>Rudyard Kipling<sup>[2]</sup></span> I find it delightful that he chose
    not to be Knighted, he did not need to look back. Some call him the finest
    example of a Gentleman.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">His poem “If” is a magnificent reminder that growing up is not optional.</div>

    <h2>IF</h2>
    <h3>Rudyard Kipling</h3>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">IF you can keep your head when all about you</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But make allowance for their doubting too;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And treat those two impostors just the same;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And stoop and build ‘em up with worn-out tools:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can make one heap of all your winnings</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And lose, and start again at your beginnings</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And never breathe a word about your loss;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To serve your turn long after they are gone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And so hold on when there is nothing in you</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If all men count with you, but none too much;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can fill the unforgiving minute</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And - which is more - you’ll be a Man, my son!</div>
