    <h2>We The Warriors</h2>
    <h3></h3>
  </header>
  <p>We the warriors in pursuits of excellence, band together in sincerity and<br>truth.</p>
  <p>May our philosophy be filled with power and may we connect in authenticity.</p>
  <p>May we strengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clear<br>thinking, and may our hatered of hypocrisy and pretence never diminish.</p>
  <p>May we inspire each other in our endeavor to live above the common levels<br>of life.</p>
  <p>May we strengthen each other to choose the harder right instead of the<br>easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth even if the whole<br>can’t be won.</p>
  <p>May we endow each other with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is<br>noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and<br>knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.</p>
  <p>May we guard each other against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred<br>things of life.</p>
  <p>May we grant each other new ties of friendship and new opportunities for<br>leadership or service.</p>
  <p>May we kindle our hearts in fellowship with those of a cheerful<br>countenance, and soften our hearts with sympathy for those who sorrow and<br>suffer.</p>
  <p>May we help each other to maintain Honor untarnished and unsullied and to<br>show forth in our lives the ideals we learned in doing our duty.</p>
  <p>All of which we ask in the names of those before us, of those who stand<br>today, and those who are yet to rise.</p>

    <h2>Modern Day</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Here, we come to today, the modern times. In the battle between the<br>Gentleman and The Officer. The Gentleman was lost. The honor code is no<br>longer aimed at Men, it is now aimed at cadets, aimed away from the public.<br>It almost seems like growing up is optional, and things get very strange in<br>deed:</p>

    <h2>Modern Day</h2>
  </header>
  <p>At times like these, where our greatest lessons are forgotten we must look<br>back at where things got lost. At times like these the Knigtly Virtues ring<br>again. As the poem says <em>The right can never die, If one man still recalls,<br>The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever<br>shines, If one heart holds it bright</em></p>
  <p>I think that one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> I find it delightful that he chose<br>not to be Knighted, he did not need to look back. Some call him the finest<br>example of a Gentleman.</p>
  <p>His poem “If” is a magnificent reminder that growing up is not optional.</p>

    <h2>IF</h2>
    <h3>Rudyard Kipling</h3>
  </header>
  <p>IF you can keep your head when all about you</p>
  <p>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</p>
  <p>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</p>
  <p>But make allowance for their doubting too;</p>
  <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</p>
  <p>Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,</p>
  <p>Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,</p>
  <p>And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
  <p>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;</p>
  <p>If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;</p>
  <p>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster</p>
  <p>And treat those two impostors just the same;</p>
  <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken</p>
  <p>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</p>
  <p>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,</p>
  <p>And stoop and build ‘em up with worn-out tools:</p>
  <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings</p>
  <p>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</p>
  <p>And lose, and start again at your beginnings</p>
  <p>And never breathe a word about your loss;</p>
  <p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</p>
  <p>To serve your turn long after they are gone,</p>
  <p>And so hold on when there is nothing in you</p>
  <p>Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>
  <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</p>
  <p>Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,</p>
  <p>if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</p>
  <p>If all men count with you, but none too much;</p>
  <p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute</p>
  <p>With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,</p>
  <p>Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,</p>
  <p>And - which is more - you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>
