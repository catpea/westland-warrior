User Interface
--------------

In the fantastic video below you will learn about the old User Interface to  
the UNIX Operating System: The Command Line Interface.

UNIX, Linux, Windows, Commodore. Can each be divided in two simple layers,  
the underlying Operating System (OS), and the front-facing User Interface  
(UI).

The UNIX Operating System

UI is not OS
------------

You should not confuse the Operating System, with the User Interface; as  
those are two separate kinds of computer programs. An Operating System, can  
have many types of User Interfaces.

Commodore 64
------------

![Commodore 64](/image/commodore.gif)

For Example, the designers of my first computer, the Commodore 64; decided  
that the best interface for a little computer is a Language Shell. Not a  
Command Line, not a Graphic User Interface, but what we would call today a  
[REPL Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), I would describe the Commodore UI as an efficient early  
Code Editor.

Commodore 64 GEOS
-----------------

In 1986 Berkeley Softworks came about and made the [GEOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system)) (Graphic  
Environment Operating System) for use with the [Commodore 1351 Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1351)

MS-DOS
------

Microsoft went through a similar upgrade. Microsoft DOS, a Command Line  
product was released in 1981.

Windows
-------

And in 1985 Microsoft released Windows version 1.0

Android's Linux
---------------

![Android's Linux](/image/aui.jpg)

The Android based Phone, is actually a Graphical User Interface to an  
underlying Linux Operating System. It is possible to prevent the loading of  
the Android Graphic User Interface, and end up in the underlying Linux  
Command Line Interface (CLI). You can then connect a USB keyboard to your  
phone, and type commands at it using the CLI.

Librem 5: Kings Cross Terminal
------------------------------

Google has locked down their own OS, they don't want to let developers in.  
So, there is a new phone on the market, that all the nerds are hoping will  
be a dream. They may actually ship with a proper Terminal, where you have a  
proper Linux (Clone of UNIX) home directory, and can install generic  
software. Visit [https://puri.sm](https://puri.sm/) for "Laptops & phones that protect the  
privacy of your family and the security of your business."

Finding Your Command Line
-------------------------

Your own operating system has a command prompt as well. If you use Windows  
it will not be as flexible as Mac, but it is still a good example of a  
Command Line Interface.

Get the $55 Raspberry PI 4
--------------------------

![Get the $55 Raspberry PI 4](/image/pi.jpg)

Windows is not the best for Command Line Interface magic, but don't worry  
you can just buy the reasonably priced [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (the green PCB  
board thing between monitors and keyboard in the picture above), make sure  
you get the latest version (It was [Raspberry PI 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/?variant=raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb) in December of  
2019). I recommend you go all out and get the maximum memory 4GB (at the  
time of writing), along with Raspberry PI branded Keyboard and Mouse, to  
show everyone that you mean business. Get two nice monitors as well (you  
don't have to get the 4K)

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
-------------------------------

![Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie](/image/tr.jpg)

When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie began creating the Unix operating  
system in 1969, they did not envision that their work would become a  
backbone of the computer revolution that has transformed the world [Â»](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Ken-Thompson-Dennis-Ritchie-win-Japan-Prize-2478569.php)

Some commands will be hard to remember, or just look too confusing. That's  
because something went wrong in their creation, maybe there wasn't enough  
funds, or the programmer was still learning UNIX.

Forgive the ugly, and remember the promise of UNIX, and UNIX-like operating  
systems. The command line is here to make your life simpler.

Dear Reader, UNIX is here to convince you that you are a wizard, hairy; and  
armed with many a fancy spell to hoot.
