User Interface

In the fantastic video below you will learn about the old User Interface tothe UNIX Operating System: The Command Line Interface.
UNIX, Linux, Windows, Commodore. Can each be divided in two simple layers,the underlying Operating System (OS), and the front-facing User Interface(UI).

The UNIX Operating System

UI is not OS

You should not confuse the Operating System, with the User Interface; asthose are two separate kinds of computer programs. An Operating System, canhave many types of User Interfaces.

Commodore 64

For Example, the designers of my first computer, the Commodore 64; decidedthat the best interface for a little computer is a Language Shell. Not aCommand Line, not a Graphic User Interface, but what we would call today aREPL Shell, I would describe the Commodore UI as an efficient earlyCode Editor.

Commodore 64 GEOS

In 1986 Berkeley Softworks came about and made the GEOS (GraphicEnvironment Operating System) for use with the Commodore 1351 Mouse

MS-DOS

Microsoft went through a similar upgrade. Microsoft DOS, a Command Lineproduct was released in 1981.

Windows

And in 1985 Microsoft released Windows version 1.0

Android's Linux

The Android based Phone, is actually a Graphical User Interface to anunderlying Linux Operating System. It is possible to prevent the loading ofthe Android Graphic User Interface, and end up in the underlying LinuxCommand Line Interface (CLI). You can then connect a USB keyboard to yourphone, and type commands at it using the CLI.

Google has locked down their own OS, they don't want to let developers in.So, there is a new phone on the market, that all the nerds are hoping willbe a dream. They may actually ship with a proper Terminal, where you have aproper Linux (Clone of UNIX) home directory, and can install genericsoftware.

Finding Your Command Line

Your own operating system has a command prompt as well. If you use Windowsit will not be as flexible as Mac, but it is still a good example of aCommand Line Interface.

Get the $55 Raspberry PI 4

Windows is not the best for Command Line Interface magic, but don't worryyou can just buy the reasonably priced Raspberry PI (the green PCBboard thing between monitors and keyboard in the picture above), make sureyou get the latest version (It was Raspberry PI 4 in December of2019). I recommend you go all out and get the maximum memory 4GB (at thetime of writing), along with Raspberry PI branded Keyboard and Mouse, toshow everyone that you mean business. Get two nice monitors as well (youdon't have to get the 4K)

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie Explain UNIX (Bell Labs)

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie

When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie began creating the Unix operatingsystem in 1969, they did not envision that their work would become abackbone of the computer revolution that has transformed the world »
Some commands will be hard to remember, or just look too confusing. That'sbecause something went wrong in their creation, maybe there wasn't enoughfunds, or the programmer was still learning UNIX.
Forgive the ugly, and remember the promise of UNIX, and UNIX-like operatingsystems. The command line is here to make your life simpler.
Dear Reader, UNIX is here to convince you that you are a wizard, hairy; andarmed with many a fancy spell to hoot.
