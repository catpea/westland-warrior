    <h2>Quote by Viktor E. Frankl</h2>
  </header>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more<br>you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued;<br>it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's<br>personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of<br>one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and<br>the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about<br>it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go<br>on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see<br>that in the long-run - in the long-run, I say! - success will follow you<br>precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.</p>

    <h2>Choose Life</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since our days in Africa we have<br>progressed forward and the word has evolved many times.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or<br>indirectly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand, even if<br>you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will surely reach<br>the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the Great Family of<br>Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that your footsteps will<br>become a well worn path, in time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The lessons come from Philosophers, Scientists, Thinkers, Soldiers,<br>Presidents, Athletes, Mercenaries, Murphy’s Law, Mighty Little Girls &<br>Young Ladies, Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers. From empathy and<br>compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster, and great challenges<br>like learning to live and grieve at the same time, or standing with the<br>demonized, disposable, or voiceless.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The lessons come from, Choosing Life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by subtle<br>analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living above the<br>common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing greatness. Striving to<br>thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning to overcome pain and<br>suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of giants to lead the way for<br>others to follow.</div>

    <h3>Walt Whitman</h3>

  <div class="paragraph">Who includes diversity and is Nature,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of<br>the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose<br>brain held audience with messengers for nothing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and<br>of the æsthetic or intellectual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by<br>subtle analogies all other theories,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other<br>globes with their suns and moons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for<br>all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</div>
