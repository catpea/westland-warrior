    <h2>Quote by Viktor E. Frankl</h2>
  </header>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more
      you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued;
      it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's
      personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of
      one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and
      the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about
      it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go
      on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see
      that in the long-run - in the long-run, I say! - success will follow you
      precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.</p>

    <h2>Choose Life</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since our days in Africa we have
    progressed forward and the word has evolved many times.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or
    indirectly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand, even if
    you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will surely reach
    the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the Great Family of
    Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that your footsteps will
    become a well worn path, in time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The lessons come from Philosophers, Scientists, Thinkers, Soldiers,
    Presidents, Athletes, Mercenaries, Murphy’s Law, Mighty Little Girls &
    Young Ladies, Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers. From empathy and
    compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster, and great challenges
    like learning to live and grieve at the same time, or standing with the
    demonized, disposable, or voiceless.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The lessons come from, Choosing Life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by subtle
    analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living above the
    common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing greatness. Striving to
    thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning to overcome pain and
    suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of giants to lead the way for
    others to follow.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Who includes diversity and is Nature,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of
    the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose
    brain held audience with messengers for nothing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and
    of the æsthetic or intellectual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by
    subtle analogies all other theories,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other
    globes with their suns and moons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for
    all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</div>
