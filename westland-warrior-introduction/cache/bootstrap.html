    Quote by Viktor E. Frankl

  <div class="card-body">
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Don&#39;t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more
        you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued;
        it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one&#39;s
        personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of
        one&#39;s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and
        the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about
        it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go
        on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see
        that in the long-run - in the long-run, I say! - success will follow you
        precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.</p>

      <p>Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since our days in Africa we have
        progressed forward and the word has evolved many times.</p>
      <p>At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or
        indirectly.</p>
      <p>Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand, even if
        you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will surely reach
        the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the Great Family of
        Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that your footsteps will
        become a well worn path, in time.</p>
      <p>The lessons come from Philosophers, Scientists, Thinkers, Soldiers,
        Presidents, Athletes, Mercenaries, Murphy’s Law, Mighty Little Girls &amp;
        Young Ladies, Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers. From empathy and
        compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster, and great challenges
        like learning to live and grieve at the same time, or standing with the
        demonized, disposable, or voiceless.</p>
      <p>The lessons come from, Choosing Life.</p>
      <p>To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by subtle
        analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living above the
        common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing greatness. Striving to
        thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning to overcome pain and
        suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of giants to lead the way for
        others to follow.</p>

      <p>Who includes diversity and is Nature,</p>

      <p>Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose
        brain held audience with messengers for nothing,</p>
