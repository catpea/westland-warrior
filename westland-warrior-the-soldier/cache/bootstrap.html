    <div class="card-text">
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium">Zeno</a> was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.</p>
      <p>According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for<br>humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not<br>allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear<br>of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part<br>in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and<br>justly.</p>
      <p>Stoicism would have influenced the Roman Soldier.</p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen">Tomoe</a> (c. 1157 - 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.</p>

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was almost<br>optional. A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into<br>retirement. A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation.</p>
      <p>It is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we find<br>hard earned inspiration and strength; because there isn&#39;t a soldier that<br>does not ask &quot;Why am I in hell?&quot;.</p>
      <p>One of the most important lessons to take away from this, is that a soldier<br>is saved inside out, not outside in.</p>

    Quote by Nitobe Inazō

  <div class="card-body">
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing<br>ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains<br>cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do<br>not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in<br>the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who,<br>for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in<br>the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in<br>the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we<br>call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always<br>room for something more.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Eight virtues of Bushido</h5>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-5 text-muted"></h6>
    <div class="card-text">
      <h3 id="righteousness">Righteousness</h3>
      <p>Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in<br>justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all<br>points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and<br>integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</p>
      <h3 id="heroic-courage">Heroic Courage</h3>
      <p>Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must<br>have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely,<br>fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and<br>strong.</p>
      <h3 id="benevolence-compassion">Benevolence, Compassion</h3>
      <p>Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and<br>strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used<br>for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every<br>opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to<br>find one.</p>
      <h3 id="respect">Respect</h3>
      <p>True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their<br>strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but<br>also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes<br>apparent during difficult times.</p>
      <h3 id="integrity">Integrity</h3>
      <p>When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done.<br>Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do<br>not have to ‘give their word’. They do not have to ‘promise’. Speaking and<br>doing are the same action.</p>
      <h3 id="honour">Honour</h3>
      <p>Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is<br>themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are<br>a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</p>
      <h3 id="duty-and-loyalty">Duty and Loyalty</h3>
      <p>Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything<br>that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are<br>immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are<br>responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</p>
      <h3 id="self-control">Self-Control</h3>
      <p>Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of<br>mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over<br>ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and<br>unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.</p>

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>I understand restoring law and peace requires armed conflict when there is<br>nothing else that can be done to help families feel safe.</p>
      <p>I don&#39;t understand why bloody battles are necessary, why they cannot be<br>prevented years before it is too late.</p>
      <p>The greater battle is in crafting the strategy of deescalation, years,<br>decades ahead.</p>
      <p>The Greatest of Heroes, conspire to prevent conflict, and foster growth; by<br>means of the Great Art of Fine Disregard for Rule.</p>

      <p>To help a family, you build a library, a school, a free university, you<br>open borders, and give them aid.</p>
      <p>You don&#39;t wait until it is too late, and call in the soldiers. War is Evil,<br>War is Hell.</p>
      <p>I think we can learn a great deal from Bryan Stevenson&#39;s words <em>Our<br>humanity depends on everyone&#39;s humanity.</em></p>
      <p>We are one family, one people, there is no &quot;them&quot;. It is just you, and me.</p>
