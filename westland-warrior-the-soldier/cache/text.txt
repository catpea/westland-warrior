Zeno of Citium

Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.
According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness forhumans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by notallowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fearof pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s partin nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly andjustly.
Stoicism would have influenced the Roman Soldier.

Marcus Aurelius

Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards thevanquished after his success against Germanic tribes. Marcus Aurelius wrotea book titled Meditations and today it is available as anAudiobook.

Tomoe Gozen

Tomoe (c. 1157 - 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.

Great Strength

Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was almostoptional. A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive intoretirement. A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation.
It is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we findhard earned inspiration and strength; because there isn't a soldier thatdoes not ask "Why am I in hell?".
One of the most important lessons to take away from this, is that a soldieris saved inside out, not outside in.

What Being a Warrior Really Means

Quote by Nitobe Inazō

A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothingruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remainscool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes donot shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, inthe menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who,for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain inthe face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or inthe voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what wecall a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has alwaysroom for something more.

Eight virtues of Bushido

Righteousness
Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe injustice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, allpoints of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice andintegrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.
Heroic Courage
Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior musthave heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely,fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent andstrong.
Benevolence, Compassion
Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick andstrong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be usedfor good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at everyopportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way tofind one.
Respect
True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove theirstrength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, butalso by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomesapparent during difficult times.
Integrity
When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done.Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They donot have to ‘give their word’. They do not have to ‘promise’. Speaking anddoing are the same action.
Honour
Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this isthemselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out area reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.
Duty and Loyalty
Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everythingthat they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They areimmensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they areresponsible for, they remain fiercely true.
Self-Control
Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure ofmind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom overignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, andunbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.

Prevention

I understand restoring law and peace requires armed conflict when there isnothing else that can be done to help families feel safe.
I don't understand why bloody battles are necessary, why they cannot beprevented years before it is too late.
The greater battle is in crafting the strategy of deescalation, years,decades ahead.
The Greatest of Heroes, conspire to prevent conflict, and foster growth; bymeans of the Great Art of Fine Disregard for Rule.

The Man Who Saved The World

Prevention, not War

To help a family, you build a library, a school, a free university, youopen borders, and give them aid.
You don't wait until it is too late, and call in the soldiers. War is Evil,War is Hell.
I think we can learn a great deal from Bryan Stevenson's words Ourhumanity depends on everyone's humanity.
We are one family, one people, there is no "them". It is just you, and me.
All cultures must leave bad ideas behind, and converge on wisdom.
Prevention.

Hope

I think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war wouldspread to no end in time. That, Knightly Virtues, Chivalry, Bushido,Stoicism, would grab a hold of Humanity and never let go, would never stopmaking us better and wiser. But even a meme has limitations, the gapsin schooling will end propagation of the most viral lessons, and povertywill return.

Poverty

Poverty, Never Changes.
Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are saying"I have kids, I need to put food on the table".
And one of the lessons we learn from this text is that "A human being ismore than the worst thing they have ever done."
There is a class of soldier that is a product of their environment. Someare an emergent property of poverty. Maximization of survival, leads to theemergence of a self taught soldier.

My path out of poverty by Lashon Amado

Hope

My friends, my heroes. The situation is only hopeless when we stand on thevery bottom. When we rise, when we rise onto the shoulders of giants,things change.
The Hopelessness of Poverty becomes transformed into a Hope. It becomes yetanother mission, a new challenge. It becomes a source of wisdom, a sourceof Great Power.
