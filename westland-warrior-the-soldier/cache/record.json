Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.</p>\n  <p>According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for\n    humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not\n    allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear\n    of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part\n    in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and\n    justly.</p>\n  <p>Stoicism would have influenced the Roman Soldier.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Marcus Aurelius</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/marcus-aurelius.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Aurelius\">\n  </figure>\n  <p>Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards the\n    vanquished after his success against Germanic tribes.

Believe in\n    justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all\n    points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and\n    integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"heroic-courage\">Heroic Courage</h3>\n  <p>Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must\n    have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely,\n    fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and\n    strong.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"benevolence-compassion\">Benevolence, Compassion</h3>\n  <p>Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and\n    strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used\n    for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every\n    opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to\n    find one.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"respect\">Respect</h3>\n  <p>True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their\n    strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but\n    also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes\n    apparent during difficult times.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"integrity\">Integrity</h3>\n  <p>When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done.\n    Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do\n    not have to ‘give their word’. They do not have to ‘promise’. Speaking and\n    doing are the same action.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"honour\">Honour</h3>\n  <p>Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is\n    themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are\n    a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"duty-and-loyalty\">Duty and Loyalty</h3>\n  <p>Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything\n    that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are\n    immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are\n    responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"self-control\">Self-Control</h3>\n  <p>Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of\n    mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over\n    ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and\n    unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Prevention</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>I understand restoring law and peace requires armed conflict when there is\n    nothing else that can be done to help families feel safe.</p>\n  <p>I don&#39;t understand why bloody battles are necessary, why they cannot be\n    prevented years before it is too late.</p>\n  <p>The greater battle is in crafting the strategy of deescalation, years,\n    decades ahead.</p>\n  <p>The Greatest of Heroes, conspire to prevent conflict, and foster growth; by\n    means of the Great Art of Fine Disregard for Rule.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Stanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7EmLf4Xlq0\" class=\"no-tufte-underline\" title=\"Stanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war\">\n      <img src=\"/image/yid-L7EmLf4Xlq0.jpg\" alt=\"Stanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war\">\n    </a>\n    <figcaption>Stanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7EmLf4Xlq0\" title=\"Stanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war\">Play Video</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Stanislav Petrov Movie</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTFUqnY3E3Q\" class=\"no-tufte-underline\" title=\"Stanislav Petrov Movie\">\n      <img src=\"/image/yid-xTFUqnY3E3Q.jpg\" alt=\"Stanislav Petrov Movie\">\n    </a>\n    <figcaption>Stanislav Petrov Movie</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTFUqnY3E3Q\" title=\"Stanislav Petrov Movie\">Play Video</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>The Man Who Saved The World</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TNdihbV5go\" class=\"no-tufte-underline\" title=\"The Man Who Saved The World\">\n      <img src=\"/image/yid-8TNdihbV5go.jpg\" alt=\"The Man Who Saved The World\">\n    </a>\n    <figcaption>The Man Who Saved The World</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TNdihbV5go\" title=\"The Man Who Saved The World\">Play Video</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Prevention, not War</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>To help a family, you build a library, a school, a free university, you\n    open borders, and give them aid.</p>\n  <p>You don&#39;t wait until it is too late, and call in the soldiers.

Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.\nAccording to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for\nhumans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not\nallowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear\nof pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part\nin nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and\njustly.\nStoicism would have influenced the Roman Soldier.\n\nMarcus Aurelius\n\nEmperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards the\nvanquished after his success against Germanic tribes. Marcus Aurelius wrote\na book titled Meditations and today it is available as an\nAudiobook.\n\nTomoe Gozen\n\nTomoe (c. 1157 - 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.\n\nGreat Strength\n\nWhere a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was almost\noptional. A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into\nretirement. A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation.\nIt is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we find\nhard earned inspiration and strength; because there isn't a soldier that\ndoes not ask \"Why am I in hell?\".\nOne of the most important lessons to take away from this, is that a soldier\nis saved inside out, not outside in.\n\nWhat Being a Warrior Really Means\n\nQuote by Nitobe Inazō\n\nA truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing\nruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains\ncool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do\nnot shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in\nthe menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who,\nfor instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in\nthe face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in\nthe voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we\ncall a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always\nroom for something more.\n\nNitobe Inazō\n\nEight virtues of Bushido\n\nRighteousness\nBe acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in\njustice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all\npoints of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and\nintegrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.\nHeroic Courage\nHiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must\nhave heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely,\nfully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and\nstrong.\nBenevolence, Compassion\nThrough intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and\nstrong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used\nfor good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every\nopportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to\nfind one.\nRespect\nTrue warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their\nstrength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but\nalso by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes\napparent during difficult times.\nIntegrity\nWhen warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done.\nNothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do\nnot have to ‘give their word’. They do not have to ‘promise’. Speaking and\ndoing are the same action.\nHonour\nWarriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is\nthemselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are\na reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.\nDuty and Loyalty\nWarriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything\nthat they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are\nimmensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are\nresponsible for, they remain fiercely true.\nSelf-Control\nWarriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of\nmind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over\nignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and\nunbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.\n\nPrevention\n\nI understand restoring law and peace requires armed conflict when there is\nnothing else that can be done to help families feel safe.\nI don't understand why bloody battles are necessary, why they cannot be\nprevented years before it is too late.\nThe greater battle is in crafting the strategy of deescalation, years,\ndecades ahead.\nThe Greatest of Heroes, conspire to prevent conflict, and foster growth; by\nmeans of the Great Art of Fine Disregard for Rule.\n\nStanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war\n\nStanislav Petrov Movie\n\nThe Man Who Saved The World\n\nPrevention, not War\n\nTo help a family, you build a library, a school, a free university, you\nopen borders, and give them aid.\nYou don't wait until it is too late, and call in the soldiers. War is Evil,\nWar is Hell.\nI think we can learn a great deal from Bryan Stevenson's words Our\nhumanity depends on everyone's humanity.\nWe are one family, one people, there is no \"them\". It is just you, and me.\nAll cultures must leave bad ideas behind, and converge on wisdom.\nPrevention.\n\nMad World Mountain Dew\n\nHope\n\nI think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war would\nspread to no end in time. That, Knightly Virtues, Chivalry, Bushido,\nStoicism, would grab a hold of Humanity and never let go, would never stop\nmaking us better and wiser. But even a meme has limitations, the gaps\nin schooling will end propagation of the most viral lessons, and poverty\nwill return.\n\nPoverty\n\nPoverty, Never Changes.\nPolice in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are saying\n\"I have kids, I need to put food on the table\".\nAnd one of the lessons we learn from this text is that \"A human being is\nmore than the worst thing they have ever done.\"\nThere is a class of soldier that is a product of their environment. Some\nare an emergent property of poverty. Maximization of survival, leads to the\nemergence of a self taught soldier.\n\nMy path out of poverty by Lashon Amado\n\nHope\n\nMy friends, my heroes. The situation is only hopeless when we stand on the\nvery bottom. When we rise, when we rise onto the shoulders of giants,\nthings change.\nThe Hopelessness of Poverty becomes transformed into a Hope. It becomes yet\nanother mission, a new challenge. It becomes a source of wisdom, a source\nof Great Power.\n\nHomie Industries\n\nKennedy Peace Speech\n\nPrevention\n\nHumanity. Dignity. Knowledge. Wisdom. Foresight. Convergence. Peace.\n\nWe Need You\n\nThe Timeless & Unbreakable Family of Great Beings needs you.\nHopes for you.\nAnd the future generations, will need your shoulders to stand on.\nRise to the challenge, become part of the thousands of years of hope, hope\nfor Peace, World Peace.\nConfident, and Unafraid.\n\n\n[Zeno]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium\n[Meditations]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations\n[Audiobook]: https://www.audible.com/pd/Meditations-Audiobook/B004IBRMZS\n[Tomoe]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen\n[meme]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme",
