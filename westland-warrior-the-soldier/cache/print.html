  <div class="paragraph"><span>Zeno<sup>[1]</sup></span> was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for
    humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not
    allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear
    of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part
    in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and
    justly.</div>

  <div class="paragraph"><span>Tomoe<sup>[4]</sup></span> (c. 1157 - 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.</div>

    <h2>Great Strength</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was almost
    optional. A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into
    retirement. A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we find
    hard earned inspiration and strength; because there isn't a soldier that
    does not ask "Why am I in hell?".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One of the most important lessons to take away from this, is that a soldier
    is saved inside out, not outside in.</div>

    <h2>Quote by Nitobe Inazō</h2>
  </header>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing
      ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains
      cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do
      not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in
      the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who,
      for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in
      the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in
      the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we
      call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always
      room for something more.</p>

    <h2>Eight virtues of Bushido</h2>
    <h3></h3>
  </header>
  <h3 id="righteousness">Righteousness</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in
    justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all
    points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and
    integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</div>
  <h3 id="heroic-courage">Heroic Courage</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must
    have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely,
    fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and
    strong.</div>
  <h3 id="benevolence-compassion">Benevolence, Compassion</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and
    strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used
    for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every
    opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to
    find one.</div>
  <h3 id="respect">Respect</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their
    strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but
    also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes
    apparent during difficult times.</div>
  <h3 id="integrity">Integrity</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done.
    Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do
    not have to ‘give their word’. They do not have to ‘promise’. Speaking and
    doing are the same action.</div>
  <h3 id="honour">Honour</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is
    themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are
    a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</div>
  <h3 id="duty-and-loyalty">Duty and Loyalty</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything
    that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are
    immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are
    responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</div>
  <h3 id="self-control">Self-Control</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of
    mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over
    ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and
    unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.</div>

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">I understand restoring law and peace requires armed conflict when there is
    nothing else that can be done to help families feel safe.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't understand why bloody battles are necessary, why they cannot be
    prevented years before it is too late.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The greater battle is in crafting the strategy of deescalation, years,
    decades ahead.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war would

  <div class="paragraph">Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are saying

  <div class="paragraph">And one of the lessons we learn from this text is that "A human being is
    more than the worst thing they have ever done."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a class of soldier that is a product of their environment. Some
    are an emergent property of poverty. Maximization of survival, leads to the
    emergence of a self taught soldier.</div>
