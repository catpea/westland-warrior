--------------------

> ... So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am  
> I going to call this research?
> 
> And the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted"
> 
> These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.
> 
> So I started looking at the data, and here's what I found:
> 
> What they had in common was a sense of courage.
> 
> Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the  
> English language -- it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" -- and  
> the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your  
> whole heart.
