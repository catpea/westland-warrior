Quote by Brené Brown

... So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what amI going to call this research?
And the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted"
These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.
So I started looking at the data, and here's what I found:
What they had in common was a sense of courage.
Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into theEnglish language -- it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" -- andthe original definition was to tell the story of who you are with yourwhole heart.

Brené Brown
