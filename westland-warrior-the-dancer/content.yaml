    ... So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am
    I going to call this research?

    And the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted"

    These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.

    So I started looking at the data, and here's what I found:

    What they had in common was a sense of courage.

    Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the
    English language -- it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" -- and
    the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your
    whole heart.
