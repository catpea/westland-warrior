    <h2>John Galt&#x27;s Speech Excerpt</h2>
    <h3></h3>
  </header>
  <p>To those of you who retain some remnant of dignity and the will to live<br>your lives for yourselves, you have the chance to make the same choice.<br>Examine your values and understand that you must choose one side or the<br>other. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps<br>the evil.</p>
  <p>If you&#39;ve understood what I&#39;ve said, stop supporting your destroyers.</p>
  <p>Don&#39;t accept their philosophy.</p>
  <p>Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your<br>innocence, and your love.</p>
  <p>Don&#39;t exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you see around<br>you now.</p>
  <p>In the name of the best within you, don&#39;t sacrifice the world to those who<br>will take away your happiness for it.</p>

    <h2>Desiderata</h2>
    <h3>Max Ehrmann</h3>
  </header>
  <p>Go placidly amid the noise and haste,</p>
  <p>and remember what peace there may be in silence.</p>
  <p>As far as possible without surrender</p>
  <p>be on good terms with all persons.</p>
  <p>Speak your truth quietly and clearly;</p>
  <p>and listen to others,</p>
  <p>even the dull and the ignorant;</p>
  <p>they too have their story.</p>
  <p>Avoid loud and aggressive persons,</p>
  <p>they are vexations to the spirit.</p>
  <p>If you compare yourself with others,</p>
  <p>you may become vain and bitter;</p>
  <p>for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</p>
  <p>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</p>
  <p>Keep interested in your own career, however humble;</p>
  <p>it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</p>
  <p>Exercise caution in your business affairs;</p>
  <p>for the world is full of trickery.</p>
  <p>But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;</p>
  <p>many persons strive for high ideals;</p>
  <p>and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>
  <p>Be yourself.</p>
  <p>Especially, do not feign affection.</p>
  <p>Neither be cynical about love;</p>
  <p>for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment</p>
  <p>it is as perennial as the grass.</p>
  <p>Take kindly the counsel of the years,</p>
  <p>gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</p>
  <p>Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.</p>
  <p>But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</p>
  <p>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</p>
  <p>Beyond a wholesome discipline,</p>
  <p>be gentle with yourself.</p>
  <p>You are a child of the universe,</p>
  <p>no less than the trees and the stars;</p>
  <p>you have a right to be here.</p>
  <p>And whether or not it is clear to you,</p>
  <p>no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</p>
  <p>Therefore be at peace with God,</p>
  <p>whatever you conceive Him to be,</p>
  <p>and whatever your labors and aspirations,</p>
  <p>in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.</p>
  <p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,</p>
  <p>it is still a beautiful world.</p>
  <p>Be cheerful.</p>
  <p>Strive to be happy.</p>

    <h2>He is not asking, he is teaching.</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Sir Ken Robinson is clearly well educated and experienced. In preparation<br>for this talk he would have wanted to come up with a powerful message, an<br>idea worth sharing. While extraordinary claims, require extraordinary<br>evidence; a simple question begs a simple answer.</p>
  <p>Yes. Schools kill creativity.</p>
