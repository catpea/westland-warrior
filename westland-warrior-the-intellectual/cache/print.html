    <h2>John Galt's Speech Excerpt</h2>
    <h3></h3>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">To those of you who retain some remnant of dignity and the will to live
    your lives for yourselves, you have the chance to make the same choice.
    Examine your values and understand that you must choose one side or the
    other. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps
    the evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you've understood what I've said, stop supporting your destroyers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't accept their philosophy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your
    innocence, and your love.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you see around
    you now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the name of the best within you, don't sacrifice the world to those who
    will take away your happiness for it.</div>

    <h3>Max Ehrmann</h3>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Go placidly amid the noise and haste,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and remember what peace there may be in silence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As far as possible without surrender</div>
  <div class="paragraph">be on good terms with all persons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Speak your truth quietly and clearly;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and listen to others,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even the dull and the ignorant;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they too have their story.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Avoid loud and aggressive persons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are vexations to the spirit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you compare yourself with others,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you may become vain and bitter;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Keep interested in your own career, however humble;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Exercise caution in your business affairs;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for the world is full of trickery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">many persons strive for high ideals;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and everywhere life is full of heroism.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be yourself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Especially, do not feign affection.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Neither be cynical about love;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is as perennial as the grass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Take kindly the counsel of the years,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Beyond a wholesome discipline,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">be gentle with yourself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are a child of the universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no less than the trees and the stars;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have a right to be here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And whether or not it is clear to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore be at peace with God,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever you conceive Him to be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and whatever your labors and aspirations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is still a beautiful world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be cheerful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Strive to be happy.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Sir Ken Robinson is clearly well educated and experienced. In preparation
    for this talk he would have wanted to come up with a powerful message, an
    idea worth sharing. While extraordinary claims, require extraordinary
    evidence; a simple question begs a simple answer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes. Schools kill creativity.</div>
