"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!"

Music & Language

You don't need to know musical notation.
Musical notation has been replaced by a SAVE BUTTON.
No, you do not need to know Musical Notation to read Chopin's Nocturnes,either.
You just import the midi file into lmms, and gaze. He is not smarter thanyou, he just sat at a piano making melodies, wrote them down arranged themin a song, and became famous for having picked nice ones.
(Don't listen to people telling you that you can't become a World FamousMaestro, because you don't know notes. They are just salty because they hadto learn them, and you don't.)
Like languages, music evolved to match our abilities. Everyone is acomposer. The rules are very simple.
Drums must be low and simple one or two keys. When making melodies don'tjump around, transition from one nearby key to another, they are grouped tosound nice together. Break the rules from time to time.

Sounds on a Timeline

Visualize notes as bright little objects on a timeline.
Watch the melody.

Guitar Hero - Simpsons Theme Song

Melody & Song Structure

Look how keys go together, only when melody gets too boring, is there ahuge shift, a kind of a bridge, to get you to the next melody.
Notice the Intro, the song does not really start until Ralph Wiggum ends upwearing Jebediah Springfield's Head as a hat.
Look how the song has quick melodies, followed by longer key presses, andquick little melodies again. This way none of the parts get boring, and thesong keeps going.
Notice the Outro. The moment Matt Groening name is displayed, a newvariation pops up, and it is a melody that has a very nice closure at theend. It does not seem to leave off unfinished, it hits those four finalnotes in a sequence, and you know it is done, and done.

The Drum Kit

Drums do beat.
Beat is what your foot does when you like a song. There will be a rhythmwithin a song almost always represented by a drum kit. A low deep soundwith some stuff happening behind it. That stuff behind it is the drum kit.
Listen, The Drum Kit, is just an instrument. If it was just the drums, itwould be like a piano with one key. There is more to drums, there are somequick sharp sounding things that go along with it.

The Drum Kit

In general the instrumental sounds that can be created here fall under fourbasic categories.
Kick from A bass drum, or kick drum
Snare from the Snare Drum
Closed Hat & Open Hat from the Hi-hat
Clap, that's the sound that clapping your hands makes.

How To Write A Melody On The Piano (For Beginners)

The Melody

It hurts my heart to say this lovely woman is doing something wrong.
As a Professional Pianist, she is brilliant, but as a teacher, she is aDestroyer of Hopes.
Don't listen to a word she says.
Watch her hands.
She is using both of them.
Her left hand is creating low-frequency sounds, and she almost never doesanything there, and she keeps things simple. She is almost doing drums withher left hand, she is laying down the beat.
Ignore her left hand, now.
Look at her right hand, at first she goes up and down. Then she does thepinky & thumb, but still, even though she is playing notes apart, see it asone note, pay attention to thumb only. She does jump between keys, but itis rare and masked by her left hand that is doing the beat.
The keys she presses at the same time with her right hand should be seen asone key, she is just mixing two sounds together to create a third sound.When she presses two keys at the same time, she is adding a third key.
Why add keys to the piano. Because two keys at the same time sounds richerthan pressing one key.
Making a single sound out of pressing multiple keys at the same time, iscalled making a chord. Chords are multiple notes played at the same time,for the purpose of enriching the complexity of what you hear.
Left hand does the simple beat, it must always be simple.
Right hand does the melody, slowly goes up and down, in this particularvideo chords aside, she only skips one key to get to the next note.
All of this is obscured, because she was taught Music Theory compatiblewith Mozart & Chopin.
You are being taught to break out. Chords are beautiful for sure, but, youjust use the recording (the sound sample a .wav/mp3 of the chord) and focuson composition.
Melodies are not made by learning how to play a piano. They are made inLMMS by gently moving up and down.

Never Fear

You must never fear.
There are many theories.
Newton, went as far as saying that he made Calculus more complicated thanit should be, on purpose.
Chopin, would never dare to simplify his work.
But that won't stop me.

Lead The Way

My Friends, My Readers, play.
Revolutionary Warriors. Lead The Way.
Let no one stand in it, may they face your wrath.
Make your own path.
Let no one play you like a piano key.
Be the change, you hope to see.
