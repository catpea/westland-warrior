He is not smarter than\nyou, he just sat at a piano making melodies, wrote them down arranged them\nin a song, and became famous for having picked nice ones.\n(Don't listen to people telling you that you can't become a World Famous\nMaestro, because you don't know notes. They are just salty because they had\nto learn them, and you don't.)\nLike languages, music evolved to match our abilities. Everyone is a\ncomposer. The rules are very simple.\nDrums must be low and simple one or two keys. When making melodies don't\njump around, transition from one nearby key to another, they are grouped to\nsound nice together.
