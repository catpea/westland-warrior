    <h2>Poverty Of Mind Comes From Lack Of Non Cognitive Skills</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Dan Cardinali's definition of Non Cognitive Skills includes the following:
    Building grit, and resilience, and persistence, and self-regulation. He's
    describing skills of a Warrior, a Fighter, an Authentic Grown Up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dan Cardinali explains that ideally families should provide Non Cognitive
    Skills (Child Development), and then schools will deliver Academic
    Development (Math, History, Physics).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But this is not how it works today, well to do parents are too busy,
    parents stricken by poverty can't have time, and non-cognitive skill
    development is not only unavailable, but is often laughed at by teachers
    "Parents do your job." they brainlessly utter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, a child born to the culture of poverty (lacking non-cognitive
    skills) will often remain in the culture of poverty be it dropping out or
    graduation. The steps out and up are just too far apart.</div>

    <h2>The Battle Against Poverty of Mind</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">It is correct to say that Poverty of Mind is rooted in lack of Non
    Cognitive Skills.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">An example of poverty of mind is inability to have an expensive lunch with
    an internship company CEO. Out of fear of not knowing <strong>EVERYTHING!</strong> from
    how to get a table to when to order, or even if it is OK to just have the
    cute little bagel and focus on the questionnaire. Lunch, if not impossible,
    can be impossibly terrifying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is no breaking out of poverty when every-step induces fear,
    confusion, anxiety.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To be clear, the ultimate aim for both Student and Principal. Almost
    always, is to rise and break away, become a CEO.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Become an inspiration and a teacher; to make life more. To then retire come
    the Golden Age of Wisdom and write. Write about the lessons that counted to
    make them last even longer. Create an Audio Book in your own voice in hopes
    of it being used 50 years from now to Rise & Learn to Really Learn. What an
    Honor to have your spirit revived by means of Admiration and Love, your own
    voice across decades, maybe centuries, maybe forever.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Instead, the children are getting scared, mostly because they can see
    schools are forcing irrelevant learning that fades away. It is impossible
    to retain irrelevant knowledge. In context of education, forcing irrelevant
    knowledge and grading a student down for lack of retention is evil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here the child does not want the job because it has too many
    complications, can't even have the internship lunch because it is too
    terrifying, and can't conceive of the notion of connecting with the CEO in
    such a way as to eventually resign position and start a company in a
    similar sector.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are scared, sometimes crushed, but far too brave to show you...
    Principal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We know what happens to most young people that can't handle fear or
    depression.</div>

    <h2>A Place of Healing</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it by intent or ignorance, anybody taking part in the fracturing of
    minds, and young minds especially, is just another monster.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A school must become a place of healing before it can hope to teach.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It must protect against all kinds of poverty, and bad parents, dangerous
    culture and bad ideas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today school is a bad place. Just another broken promise.</div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[My] recruiting does not have anything that says "Requires University"
      because that's absurd, but there is a requirement of evidence of
      exceptional ability. [...] I don't consider going to college evidence of
      exceptional ability in fact ideally you dropped out and did something
      [exceptional].</p>

    <h2>The Battle Against Poverty of Mind</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">What can be easier than to help a child grow?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what can be more rewarding than to be Admired, Loved, Remembered? To have a
    High School named after you upon your retirement, and have every student
    that goes there at least look at your picture with your beloved students
    hugging you as if you were their own Mother.</div>

    <h2>A Meaningful Life Calls For Real Education</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Focus on Real Education, not Administration. If you need money, then look
    to your students.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Become a Start-up Accelerator. Give them initial mentoring and funding,
    Take a small percentage of their earnings in return for the initial funding
    and in order to fund other start-ups. Take only for a small number of
    years, and only what you need. Get out of their way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Never forget, Principal. You serve The Kids, The Students, they are the
    point of it all, they are the future. The Children are not your means to
    staying in business and getting paid- that would make you a Monster and a
    Fraud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The best way to fight poverty in a person's mind, is to set a student up
    for a job so high up, that it will make them want to run out of the school
    quietly-yelling and hope they never need to come back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A prestigious position at a local Hospital as a Research Nurse that keeps
    everyone informed a month ahead of time, a complicated job at the Library
    of Congress, or as Someone Amazing at the Detroit Institute of Arts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Set a step so high, that it is already a healthy career but completely
    unreachable to the child, the step up being, Just Impossible. And then
    slowly, build. But smaller steps, and maybe even smaller, or maybe even an
    on-ramp for a smooth ride.</div>

    amount of help beyond Belief and Love which is already wonderful. Donna
    Watkins (Talitha's community-school site coordinator) looked for <strong>every
developmental opportunity</strong>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Talitha must have said she was scared to go to the Fancy Lunch and Donna
    came to her rescue, that is so brave and so sweet.</div>

    <h2>Non Cognitive Skills Must Come First</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Academic Development can't succeed on its own, it is incompatible with who
    we are, we are not machines that can make room for knowledge on our
    long-term storage drive. Even with a blooming ecosystem of Memory Palaces,
    that which is irrelevant to out Hearts and Existence will be soon forgotten.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This parade through classes, levels, and subjects is a waste of time. Our
    time is precious, life is so dear. There simply is no time for charades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Principal, stand up, and deliver.</div>
