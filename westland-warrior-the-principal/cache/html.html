    <h2>Poverty Of Mind Comes From Lack Of Non Cognitive Skills</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Dan Cardinali&#39;s definition of Non Cognitive Skills includes the following:<br>Building grit, and resilience, and persistence, and self-regulation. He&#39;s<br>describing skills of a Warrior, a Fighter, an Authentic Grown Up.</p>
  <p>Dan Cardinali explains that ideally families should provide Non Cognitive<br>Skills (Child Development), and then schools will deliver Academic<br>Development (Math, History, Physics).</p>
  <p>But this is not how it works today, well to do parents are too busy,<br>parents stricken by poverty can&#39;t have time, and non-cognitive skill<br>development is not only unavailable, but is often laughed at by teachers<br>&quot;Parents do your job.&quot; they brainlessly utter.</p>
  <p>Above all, a child born to the culture of poverty (lacking non-cognitive<br>skills) will often remain in the culture of poverty be it dropping out or<br>graduation. The steps out and up are just too far apart.</p>

    <h2>The Battle Against Poverty of Mind</h2>
  </header>
  <p>It is correct to say that Poverty of Mind is rooted in lack of Non<br>Cognitive Skills.</p>
  <p>An example of poverty of mind is inability to have an expensive lunch with<br>an internship company CEO. Out of fear of not knowing <strong>EVERYTHING!</strong> from<br>how to get a table to when to order, or even if it is OK to just have the<br>cute little bagel and focus on the questionnaire. Lunch, if not impossible,<br>can be impossibly terrifying.</p>
  <p>There is no breaking out of poverty when every-step induces fear,<br>confusion, anxiety.</p>
  <p>To be clear, the ultimate aim for both Student and Principal. Almost<br>always, is to rise and break away, become a CEO.</p>
  <p>Become an inspiration and a teacher; to make life more. To then retire come<br>the Golden Age of Wisdom and write. Write about the lessons that counted to<br>make them last even longer. Create an Audio Book in your own voice in hopes<br>of it being used 50 years from now to Rise &amp; Learn to Really Learn. What an<br>Honor to have your spirit revived by means of Admiration and Love, your own<br>voice across decades, maybe centuries, maybe forever.</p>
  <p>Instead, the children are getting scared, mostly because they can see<br>schools are forcing irrelevant learning that fades away. It is impossible<br>to retain irrelevant knowledge. In context of education, forcing irrelevant<br>knowledge and grading a student down for lack of retention is evil.</p>
  <p>And here the child does not want the job because it has too many<br>complications, can&#39;t even have the internship lunch because it is too<br>terrifying, and can&#39;t conceive of the notion of connecting with the CEO in<br>such a way as to eventually resign position and start a company in a<br>similar sector.</p>
  <p>They are scared, sometimes crushed, but far too brave to show you...<br>Principal.</p>
  <p>We know what happens to most young people that can&#39;t handle fear or<br>depression.</p>

    <h2>A Place of Healing</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Be it by intent or ignorance, anybody taking part in the fracturing of<br>minds, and young minds especially, is just another monster.</p>
  <p>A school must become a place of healing before it can hope to teach.</p>
  <p>It must protect against all kinds of poverty, and bad parents, dangerous<br>culture and bad ideas.</p>
  <p>Today school is a bad place. Just another broken promise.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[My] recruiting does not have anything that says &quot;Requires University&quot;<br>because that&#39;s absurd, but there is a requirement of evidence of<br>exceptional ability.

  <p>What can be easier than to help a child grow?</p>
  <p>what can be more rewarding than to be Admired, Loved, Remembered? To have a<br>High School named after you upon your retirement, and have every student<br>that goes there at least look at your picture with your beloved students<br>hugging you as if you were their own Mother.</p>

    <h2>A Meaningful Life Calls For Real Education</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Focus on Real Education, not Administration. If you need money, then look<br>to your students.</p>
  <p>Become a Start-up Accelerator. Give them initial mentoring and funding,<br>Take a small percentage of their earnings in return for the initial funding<br>and in order to fund other start-ups. Take only for a small number of<br>years, and only what you need. Get out of their way.</p>
  <p>Never forget, Principal. You serve The Kids, The Students, they are the<br>point of it all, they are the future. The Children are not your means to<br>staying in business and getting paid- that would make you a Monster and a<br>Fraud.</p>
  <p>The best way to fight poverty in a person&#39;s mind, is to set a student up<br>for a job so high up, that it will make them want to run out of the school<br>quietly-yelling and hope they never need to come back.</p>
  <p>A prestigious position at a local Hospital as a Research Nurse that keeps<br>everyone informed a month ahead of time, a complicated job at the Library<br>of Congress, or as Someone Amazing at the Detroit Institute of Arts.</p>
  <p>Set a step so high, that it is already a healthy career but completely<br>unreachable to the child, the step up being, Just Impossible. And then<br>slowly, build. But smaller steps, and maybe even smaller, or maybe even an<br>on-ramp for a smooth ride.</p>

    <h2>Every Developmental Opportunity</h2>
  </header>
  <p>It is not just &quot;grit, and resilience, and persistence, and<br>self-regulation&quot;, Dan Cardinali shows that Talitha Halley had enormous<br>amount of help beyond Belief and Love which is already wonderful. Donna<br>Watkins (Talitha&#39;s community-school site coordinator) looked for <strong>every<br>developmental opportunity</strong>.</p>
  <p>Talitha must have said she was scared to go to the Fancy Lunch and Donna<br>came to her rescue, that is so brave and so sweet.</p>

    <h2>Non Cognitive Skills Must Come First</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Academic Development can&#39;t succeed on its own, it is incompatible with who<br>we are, we are not machines that can make room for knowledge on our<br>long-term storage drive. Even with a blooming ecosystem of Memory Palaces,<br>that which is irrelevant to out Hearts and Existence will be soon forgotten.</p>
  <p>This parade through classes, levels, and subjects is a waste of time. Our<br>time is precious, life is so dear. There simply is no time for charades.</p>
  <p>Principal, stand up, and deliver.</p>
