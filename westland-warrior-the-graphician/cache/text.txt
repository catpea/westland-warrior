Demoscene

Demoscene has been closely related to the world of pixel art, demos for computers like the Commodore 64 (1982) still feature in the Demoscene today. The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audio-visual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend, and released online. Take a look at Best Of Demoscene 2019 on YouTube
