Endurance Training
------------------

Bruce Lee, was the first Ultra that I have heard of. Ultras are folks like  
you and I that train to jump a little seedling of corn. Day by day,  
GRADUALLY, the little corn grows a little bit taller, and the little ultra  
strives to jump a little bit higher.

In modern times the C25K comes to mind, meet [Fierce Carli](http://carlifierce.com/10-k-downloads/) Just from  
plain experience with jogging we can guesstimate that by GRADUALLY  
increasing the length of distance, we will gain the endurance to run  
hundreds of miles.

It is the training, not genetics.
---------------------------------

Dean Karnazes, mentions Lactic Acid build up. I think of it as mostly  
nonsense, where does the lactic acid go when your performance increases  
from long distance running? Your first mile the first time you run will  
burn, but the 10,000th time you will feel elation. Genetics are a myth.

Here is Dean’s book, it is a good read, and a good Audiobook. It contains  
growing up, and adventures, and stories of triumph, and aches.

Pain Does Not Hurt
------------------

Pain, is just a chemical signal, it is a squirt of goo – pain my dear  
friends, does not hurt.

There Is No Later
-----------------

It is when you stop, and all time scrolls by you, that really hurts. This  
is why I write to the youngest of you, one of the greatest Storytellers of  
all generations once discovered a great wish that we all wish for  
eventually.

Make me young again

Make Me Young
-------------

“Make me young again” - but you are young now, you can make most of it, no  
wax, because it is all ahead of you. Go, close your eyes and connect with  
your 80 year old self, and make the wish Killgore Trout did: “Make Me Young  
Again”, and open your eyes, and be young but wiser for it. Therein you will  
discover the nature of the Ultra. While we live our only life, poetically  
we live as it was countless lives already. By wiggling forward and back we  
can see where we are headed, and end up where we always wished to be.

Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence

Eternal Recurrence
------------------

[Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) is asking you to review your decisions, treat them with more gravity, “Would you be willing to relive your life again, and again, and again? Or would you prefer to stay dead and if so, then you need to review your decision making.”:

Quote by Friedrich Nietzsche
----------------------------

> _The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal  
> after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:_
> 
> _This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live  
> once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it,  
> but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh… must return to  
> you—all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this  
> moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal  
> hourglass of existence is turned over again and again—and you with it,  
> speck of dust!_
> 
> _Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon  
> who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you  
> would have answered him: “You are a god, and never have I heard anything  
> more divine!”_
> 
> _If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you  
> are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, “do you  
> want this once more and innumerable times more?” would lie upon your  
> actions as the greatest weight._
> 
> \-- Friedrich Nietzsche

Wisdom and Endurance
--------------------

The workout is powered by the soul of a very old warrior, who lived many a  
lifetime in daydreams, stories, books, and poems. There is no pain, it is  
just a signal.

On the Mind part, focus on gaining wisdom by all means. On the body part,  
keep extending your endurance, the pain is too primitive to catch up with  
an ultra.
