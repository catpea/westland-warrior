Ultras are folks like  \nyou and I that train to jump a little seedling of corn. Day by day,  \nGRADUALLY, the little corn grows a little bit taller, and the little ultra  \nstrives to jump a little bit higher.\n\nIn modern times the C25K comes to mind, meet [Fierce Carli](http://carlifierce.com/10-k-downloads/) Just from  \nplain experience with jogging we can guesstimate that by GRADUALLY  \nincreasing the length of distance, we will gain the endurance to run  \nhundreds of miles.\n\nQuote by Dean Karnazes\n----------------------\n\n> The human body has limitations. The human spirit is boundless.\n> \n> \\-- Dean Karnazes\n\nDean Karnazes\n-------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-Mtp65SWoyWc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtp65SWoyWc)\n\nQuote by Dean Karnazes\n----------------------\n\n> The finish line, is a pine box.\n> \n> \\-- Dean Karnazes\n\nIt is the training, not genetics.\n---------------------------------\n\nDean Karnazes, mentions Lactic Acid build up. I think of it as mostly  \nnonsense, where does the lactic acid go when your performance increases  \nfrom long distance running? Your first mile the first time you run will  \nburn, but the 10,000th time you will feel elation. Genetics are a myth.\n\nHere is Dean’s book, it is a good read, and a good Audiobook. It contains  \ngrowing up, and adventures, and stories of triumph, and aches.  \n[Ultramarathon Man](https://www.audible.com/pd/Ultramarathon-Man-Audiobook/B002VA3GIU)\n\nPain Does Not Hurt\n------------------\n\nPain, is just a chemical signal, it is a squirt of goo – pain my dear  \nfriends, does not hurt.\n\nImagine Dragons - Believer\n--------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-7wtfhZwyrcc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wtfhZwyrcc)\n\nThere Is No Later\n-----------------\n\nIt is when you stop, and all time scrolls by you, that really hurts.

Go, close your eyes and connect with  \nyour 80 year old self, and make the wish Killgore Trout did: “Make Me Young  \nAgain”, and open your eyes, and be young but wiser for it. Therein you will  \ndiscover the nature of the Ultra. While we live our only life, poetically  \nwe live as it was countless lives already. By wiggling forward and back we  \ncan see where we are headed, and end up where we always wished to be.\n\nNietzsche's Eternal Recurrence\n------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-EknD3KRtgDk.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EknD3KRtgDk)\n\nEternal Recurrence\n------------------\n\n[Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) is asking you to review your decisions, treat them with more gravity, “Would you be willing to relive your life again, and again, and again? Or would you prefer to stay dead and if so, then you need to review your decision making.”:\n\nQuote by Friedrich Nietzsche\n----------------------------\n\n> _The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal  \n> after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:_\n> \n> _This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live  \n> once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it,  \n> but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh… must return to  \n> you—all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this  \n> moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal  \n> hourglass of existence is turned over again and again—and you with it,  \n> speck of dust!_\n> \n> _Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon  \n> who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you  \n> would have answered him: “You are a god, and never have I heard anything  \n> more divine!”_\n> \n> _If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you  \n> are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, “do you  \n> want this once more and innumerable times more?” would lie upon your  \n> actions as the greatest weight._\n> \n> \\-- Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nWisdom and Endurance\n--------------------\n\nThe workout is powered by the soul of a very old warrior, who lived many a  \nlifetime in daydreams, stories, books, and poems. There is no pain, it is  \njust a signal.\n\nOn the Mind part, focus on gaining wisdom by all means. On the body part,  \nkeep extending your endurance, the pain is too primitive to catch up with  \nan ultra.",
