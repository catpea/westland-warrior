Quote by Bruce Lee

I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the manwho has practiced one kick 10,000 times.

Endurance Training

Bruce Lee, was the first Ultra that I have heard of. Ultras are folks likeyou and I that train to jump a little seedling of corn. Day by day,GRADUALLY, the little corn grows a little bit taller, and the little ultrastrives to jump a little bit higher.
In modern times the C25K comes to mind, meet Fierce Carli Just fromplain experience with jogging we can guesstimate that by GRADUALLYincreasing the length of distance, we will gain the endurance to runhundreds of miles.

Quote by Dean Karnazes

The finish line, is a pine box.

Dean Karnazes

It is the training, not genetics.

Dean Karnazes, mentions Lactic Acid build up. I think of it as mostlynonsense, where does the lactic acid go when your performance increasesfrom long distance running? Your first mile the first time you run willburn, but the 10,000th time you will feel elation. Genetics are a myth.
Here is Dean’s book, it is a good read, and a good Audiobook. It containsgrowing up, and adventures, and stories of triumph, and aches.Ultramarathon Man

Pain Does Not Hurt

Pain, is just a chemical signal, it is a squirt of goo – pain my dearfriends, does not hurt.

Imagine Dragons - Believer

There Is No Later

It is when you stop, and all time scrolls by you, that really hurts. Thisis why I write to the youngest of you, one of the greatest Storytellers ofall generations once discovered a great wish that we all wish foreventually.

Make me young again

Make Me Young

“Make me young again” - but you are young now, you can make most of it, nowax, because it is all ahead of you. Go, close your eyes and connect withyour 80 year old self, and make the wish Killgore Trout did: “Make Me YoungAgain”, and open your eyes, and be young but wiser for it. Therein you willdiscover the nature of the Ultra. While we live our only life, poeticallywe live as it was countless lives already. By wiggling forward and back wecan see where we are headed, and end up where we always wished to be.

Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence

Eternal Recurrence

Friedrich Nietzsche is asking you to review your decisions, treat them with more gravity, “Would you be willing to relive your life again, and again, and again? Or would you prefer to stay dead and if so, then you need to review your decision making.”:

Quote by Friedrich Nietzsche

The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to stealafter you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:
This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to liveonce more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it,but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh… must return toyou—all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and thismoonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternalhourglass of existence is turned over again and again—and you with it,speck of dust!
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demonwho spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when youwould have answered him: “You are a god, and never have I heard anythingmore divine!”
If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as youare, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, “do youwant this once more and innumerable times more?” would lie upon youractions as the greatest weight.

Friedrich Nietzsche

Wisdom and Endurance

The workout is powered by the soul of a very old warrior, who lived many alifetime in daydreams, stories, books, and poems. There is no pain, it isjust a signal.
On the Mind part, focus on gaining wisdom by all means. On the body part,keep extending your endurance, the pain is too primitive to catch up withan ultra.
