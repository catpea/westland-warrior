[Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator_(company))  \nand [Techstars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techstars).\n\nY Combinator\n------------\n\n[Website](https://www.ycombinator.com/) · [Y Combinator on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcefcZRL2oaA_uBNeo5UOWg)\n\n[Startup School Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ-uHSnFig5MiLRb-l6yiCBGyqfVyVf17)\n\nWhat is Y Combinator?\n---------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-_4JtyLKDjXk.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk)\n\nHow and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman & Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-ZoqgAy3h4OM.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM)\n\nInvestors Are Waiting\n---------------------\n\nY Combinator created [Requests for Startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/), a list of startup ideas  \nthey are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services,  \nProgramming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few.\n\nYC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference\n------------------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-waYiVrIGQ_0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waYiVrIGQ_0)\n\nFundraising Advice from Female Founders\n---------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-GHoTciAH8Uo.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoTciAH8Uo)\n\nThe Most Important Decision is Getting Started – Laura Behrens Wu\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-ZAkzs4rgjOo.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAkzs4rgjOo)\n\nMariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-gmA-BOIVKQU.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmA-BOIVKQU)\n\nEmily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-ex-fXyRJTU8.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex-fXyRJTU8)\n\nTechstars\n---------\n\n[Website](https://www.techstars.com/) · [Techstars on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClebMzrpRNTWVfZXw2jfsSw)\n\nWhat is Techstars?\n------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-S-3YgWroCdo.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-3YgWroCdo)\n\nWhat Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories\n----------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-Apr2B7Ix0zs.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apr2B7Ix0zs)\n\nMary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity\n---------------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-NE6jxVk7G-8.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE6jxVk7G-8)\n\nSky Kelley, Founder of Avisare\n------------------------------\n\n[![]( /image/yid-oRjHsum2ImI.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRjHsum2ImI)\n\nQuote by Sun Tzu\n----------------\n\n> Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors  \n> go to war first and then seek to win.\n> \n> \\-- Sun Tzu - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\\_Tzu\n\nMastery of Subject\n------------------\n\nWhat Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: \"Victorious warriors, master the  \nsword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use  \nthe sword during their first sword-fight.\"\n\nCreating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out  \nany paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an  \nAccelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between  \nadvertising budget, number of developers, and product sales.\n\nWhat may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become  \nenergizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it.\n\nIt Is a Big World\n-----------------\n\nLarge Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there  \nare [many more](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=List+of+Startup+Accelerators&t=ffab&ia=web) smaller ones.\n\nRemember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you  \nmake money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of  \ndistance towards success.\n\nGood Ideas\n----------\n\nA good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in.\n\n[Google Ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV4DCdyLNgU) is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they are ready for their first sale.\n\n[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) or similar, is another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has screenshots, and no time to work on the website.\n\n[Wrap Bootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/): User Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and have the UI snippets ready.\n\n[Parse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89xIe8FbR2g), because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open Sourced, and all of the code is available here: [https://parseplatform.org/](https://parseplatform.org/)\n\nDanger\n------\n\n**Learning Programming** to begin creating such marvels, will also destroy  \nthe pillars behind them; as the languages twist them to meet your own  \ndeadlines.\n\nSitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for  \nresearch, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines.\n\nYou must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end,  \nthere may be many).\n\nYou must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that's  \nright - [lead your team to victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM).\n\nSource of Ideas\n---------------\n\nThe best source of ideas, is a list of [Winning Companies](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/).\n\nInvestors [Requesting for Startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/).\n\n[List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet).\n\n[Profit Hunt](http://profithunt.co/) (a play on [Product Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Hunt)) has many smaller ideas along with Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).",
