    A Warrior is She that thrives and triumphs where’er She be.

    You cannot be broken, you must use your misfortune to light your way.

    <br><br>

    You can learn anything you want, there are no smarter.

    They are just actors, with a handful of fragile lessons, crafted to impress.

    <br><br>

    There is nothing that can break you, there are no stronger.

    Look to the source of the pain, it comes from Innocence.

    <br><br>

    Nothing rooted in Innocence is ugly, all lessons that come from being tricked,

    add up to make you more beautiful, enable your insight and foresight, and fuel your authenticity.

    <br><br>

    When the regrets come at night, that's just you brain asking you,

    to think harder, to comprehend your beauty in full,

    <br><br>

    No one can trick you, not for long enough. So, don't be scared.

    Memoirs, Audio-books, Lectures will show you how many better people there are.

    <br><br>

    We all have to Enlarge our Worlds daily.

    Audiobooks, and Lectures, will show you that all you have met thus far were just the same type of person.

    <br><br>

    Do not be afraid to rise.

    The people, or person you have long though about, exist.

    But before they can see you, you have to rise, and shine, and be seen.

    <br><br>

    Don't be scared.

    <br><br>

    Those who will use your Love, Innocence, Endurance and Generosity against you,

    have long been lost, they are blinded, and fractured, and damaged, and broken.

    <br><br>

    They hold no power over you.

    <br><br>

    If their attacks continue they will grind themselves to dust,

    and all the experiences that will be left in their wake, will make you stronger and better.

    <br><br>

    Battles make you stronger, smarter, more beautiful.

    You are a Warrior, that's the oldest name for it.

    <br><br>

    A Warrior is She that uses the harm that came her way as energy,

    who understands none can stay a child and all must grow, and enlarge their worlds.

    <br><br>

    A Warrior can never be damaged, or hurt -- a Warrior Learns.

    A Warrior resists tears in the rain, just like she can resist weakness.

    <br><br>

    We live in a fragile world, full of fragile people, with fragile egos,

    they speak fragile advice, with fragile words; from their fragile hills.

    <br><br>

    A Warrior does not wait to be taught.

    A Warrior learns fastest on her own.

    <br><br>

    Learn in the sequence that fits you best,

    learn at the pace that helps you most.

    <br><br>

    Push the dark imaginings back,

    and rise.

    <br><br>

    Move your hand.

    <br><br>

    And push up.

    <br><br>

    And stand up.

    <br><br>

    Get ready to walk,

    and then run, day, after day, slightly longer.

    <br><br>

    And then lift your weights, the way you learned to run,

    and then lift for longer,
    and never rest.

    <br><br>

    And then, with your sweetest audio-book.

    <br><br>

    Step.

    <br><br>

    Step Up.

    <br><br>

    Rise Up.

    <br><br>

    To No End.

    <br><br>

    This is The Life Of A Warrior.

    <br><br>

    Nothing Can Crush You,

    Nothing Can Hold You.

    <br><br>

    Don't You See?

    <br><br>

    Everything Makes You Stronger,

    Everything Makes You Fight Longer.

    <br><br>

    You,

    Are A Warrior.
