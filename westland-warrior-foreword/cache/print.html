  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Warrior is She that thrives and triumphs where’er She be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You cannot be broken, you must use your misfortune to light your way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can learn anything you want, there are no smarter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They are just actors, with a handful of fragile lessons, crafted to impress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing that can break you, there are no stronger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look to the source of the pain, it comes from Innocence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing rooted in Innocence is ugly, all lessons that come from being tricked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">add up to make you more beautiful, enable your insight and foresight, and fuel your authenticity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the regrets come at night, that's just you brain asking you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to think harder, to comprehend your beauty in full,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one can trick you, not for long enough. So, don't be scared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Memoirs, Audio-books, Lectures will show you how many better people there are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">We all have to Enlarge our Worlds daily.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Audiobooks, and Lectures, will show you that all you have met thus far were just the same type of person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Do not be afraid to rise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The people, or person you have long though about, exist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But before they can see you, you have to rise, and shine, and be seen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't be scared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Those who will use your Love, Innocence, Endurance and Generosity against you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">have long been lost, they are blinded, and fractured, and damaged, and broken.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">They hold no power over you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">If their attacks continue they will grind themselves to dust,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the experiences that will be left in their wake, will make you stronger and better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Battles make you stronger, smarter, more beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are a Warrior, that's the oldest name for it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Warrior is She that uses the harm that came her way as energy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who understands none can stay a child and all must grow, and enlarge their worlds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Warrior can never be damaged, or hurt -- a Warrior Learns.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Warrior resists tears in the rain, just like she can resist weakness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">We live in a fragile world, full of fragile people, with fragile egos,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they speak fragile advice, with fragile words; from their fragile hills.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Warrior does not wait to be taught.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A Warrior learns fastest on her own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learn in the sequence that fits you best,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">learn at the pace that helps you most.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Push the dark imaginings back,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and rise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Move your hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">And push up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">And stand up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Get ready to walk,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then run, day, after day, slightly longer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then lift your weights, the way you learned to run,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then lift for longer,
    and never rest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then, with your sweetest audio-book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Step.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Step Up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rise Up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">To No End.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">This is The Life Of A Warrior.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing Can Crush You,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing Can Hold You.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't You See?</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything Makes You Stronger,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything Makes You Fight Longer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><br><br></div>
  <div class="paragraph">You,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are A Warrior.</div>
