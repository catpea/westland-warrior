In this case we would execute: man print</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>The Simplest Form</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>In the following example there is one argument &quot;hello world&quot;. Without<br>quotes the command would see two arguments &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot;. Quotes are<br>used to join two or more things together.</p>\n  <p>print &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>The Extended Form</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>In the next example we have a Boolean flag &quot;-u&quot; meaning enable underline<br>mode. To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have<br>the extended argument &quot;--format&quot; followed by a directive &quot;capitalize&quot;.<br>Supported directives can be found in documentation.</p>\n  <p>print -u --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n  <p>To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended<br>arguments, so --format can become -f.</p>\n  <p>print -u -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n  <p>Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that<br>begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.</p>\n  <p>print --underline -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n  <p>For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.</p>\n  <p>print --underline --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Why would anyone want to apply a Command-line interface to something?</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>Because of the uniformity of command syntax.

Note that once the<br>telnet connection is established at line number 22, we begin using the<br>coffeemaker command-line interface: sys brew (line 26), sys pour (line 32).</p>\n  <p>Don&#39;t think of the coffeemaker as running UNIX, just think of it as it<br>being controlled by a command line interface somewhere.</p>\n  <p>Any machine with a button or two is a system with enough complexity to<br>benefit from a command-line interface.</p>\n  <p>Note how you have never programmed a coffeemaker before, and yet you know<br>precisely - and may even remember for months to come - the commands &quot;sys<br>brew&quot; and &quot;sys pour&quot;.</p>\n  <p>sys brew</p>\n  <p>sys pour</p>\n  <p>It seems sys is a single command that looks at the first text argument.<br>Executing sys -h would probably print:</p>\n  <p> Coffemaker Help ---- -h / --help print this text -v / --verbose print<br>debugging information -b / --brew / or simply brew start brewing -p /<br>--pour / or simply pour start pouring -r / --reboot / or simply reboot<br>reboot the system ... </p>\n  <p>Lack of proper etiquette, and using text (brew) instead of arguments<br>(--brew/-b) can be an indication of sys being a script that does not take<br>the time to parse anything it just looks at the first thing after the<br>command name. It is actually difficult to parse arguments (-b/--brew), it<br>takes no effort at all to use raw text (brew).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Smart Coffeemaker</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/section8.png\" alt=\"Smart Coffeemaker\">\n  </figure>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.mrcoffee.com/wemo-landing-page.html\">Mr. Coffee Smart Coffeemaker enabled with WeMo</a> can be controlled with the bootleg <a href=\"https://github.com/timonreinhard/wemo-client\">node.js client for WeMo</a> found on github.

Quotes are<br>used to join two or more things together.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">print \"hello world\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>The Extended Form</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In the next example we have a Boolean flag \"-u\" meaning enable underline<br>mode. To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have<br>the extended argument \"--format\" followed by a directive \"capitalize\".<br>Supported directives can be found in documentation.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">print -u --format capitalize \"hello world\"</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended<br>arguments, so --format can become -f.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">print -u -f capitalize \"hello world\"</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that<br>begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">print --underline -f capitalize \"hello world\"</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">print --underline --format capitalize \"hello world\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Why would anyone want to apply a Command-line interface to something?</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Because of the uniformity of command syntax.

Often programs may need to be configured somehow, be it a<br>configuration file, or just editing code. Programs may be hard to run,<br>because every program is different.</p>\n      <p>When a programmer decides to turn his program into a command, something<br>wonderful happens.

  "text": "Keyboards & Command Line Interfaces[1]\n\nCRASH COURSE COMPUTER SCIENCE\n\nWatch the Full Playlist[2] of 41 videos.\n\nA SHORT INTRODUCTION TO COMMANDS\n\nA command is a program made easy to execute. In other words by turning a\nprogram into a command, the programmer standardizes the execution and\ncustomization of the program.\nUsually programs need compilation, or an interpreter, they need some\nlibraries. Often programs may need to be configured somehow, be it a\nconfiguration file, or just editing code. Programs may be hard to run,\nbecause every program is different.\nWhen a programmer decides to turn his program into a command, something\nwonderful happens. The programmer adds a bunch of stuff to his program to\nmake it into a command, and thus standardizes the way the program is ran\nand customized.\n\nCOMMANDS AT A GLANCE\n\nHere is what a command really looks like:\ncommand-name --some-argument value-of-the-argument\ngmail --recipient alice@aol.com --subject \"I can't even!\" --message \"I\ncan't freaking believe it, commands are cool, rawr!\"\n\nCOMMANDS CAN DO ANYTHING\n\nCommands usually come in groups, for example there is a group of commands\nthat manage files and directories, a group of commands that compress files,\nor download files across the internet.\nGetting Around in the Unix Command Line Interface[3]\n\nFULL RASPBERRY PI TUTORIAL PLAYLIST\n\nFull Raspberry Pi Tutorial Playlist Â»[4]\n\nFILE MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\n\nManage files and directories with touch[5], ls[6], cp[7], mkdir[8],\nrmdir[9], mv[10], and rm[11] to name a few. If you use a file manager\nwith a graphic user interface (GUI), then you don't need to worry about\nthese.\n\nFILE COMPRESSION COMMANDS\n\nA group of commands for compressing files to save space gzip[12],\ntar[13], and bzip2[14] to name a few.\n\nFILE DOWNLOAD COMMAND\n\nSome commands are so good at what they do there is only a couple of them\nwget[15] and curl[16] are a good example of that. cURL downloads files\nreally well, it is also very frequently used for debugging or testing\nweb-servers that serve files, it is a very efficient program. wget is\nawesome at resuming downloads and downloading large files, it actually has\na feature that not only downloads a web page, but also all the images and\nother web pages that are linked to it.\nThere are also some really eyebrow raising commands like youtube-dl[17]\nwhich comes with an --extract-audio argument, meaning, it will make an mp3\nout of a video.\nI don't know what Alphabet's Terms of Service state on the subject of\ndownloading their data. I don't recommend you use this command, unless you\nfamiliarize yourself with their Terms of Service, specifics of downloading\ncontent with third-party tools, and own the content yourself. Note that it\nis not just a YouTube account that may get suspended, but all the rest too,\ngmail and google docs, stuff on your android phone, etc.\nHere is what the command would look for a YouTube Creator hoping to make a\nbackup of a particular video.\nyoutube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\\_VIDEO\\_ID[18]\nAnd here is the code for saving just the audio it self, this is useful for\nmaking an audio only version of an adventure video or remixing your content\nin a song.\nyoutube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\\_VIDEO\\_ID[19]\nLook how simple and easy to read. Commands can save you from thousands of\nmouse clicks and hours of annoying, repetitive work. Commands are a\nbeautiful invention. Graphic user interfaces are helpful when learning\ncomputers, but eventually they will force you into a world of clicks.\n\nCOMMANDS ARE FRIENDS!\n\nIt is so awesome to just open a terminal, type in gmail alice@aol.com -s\n\"About Cybertruck\" -m \"So did you get the $69K build?\" and go have your\nIrish Breakfast Tea (or an Earl Gray with an extra lump of sugar and an\nextended pinkie) a whole 35 seconds earlier, because you didn't have to\nwait for the mail window to open and start sucking memory whilst inspecting\nits innards.\nHow To Hack Time[20]\n\nSIMPLICITY LOST\n\nOriginally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable, readable, and\nnot causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are well thought out.\nBut, people will cram a lot more than they should, and it gets out of\ncontrol, here is a mild example of mixing some video files with the ffmpeg\ncommand.\nffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy\n-acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio\nI have some guesses as to what the ff stands for. You can visit the manual\npage here: https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg[21]\n\nPIPES\n\nThere is a feature in the command world, that can deal with high\ncomplexity, and that is the pipe. Meaning two commands can be connected by\na pipe in the following manner\nprint \"hello world\" | uppercase\nThis would result in changing all text to uppercase, and printing it on the\nscreen.\nHELLO WORLD\n\nREDIRECTS\n\nThere is also a feature of pipes that creates files and that is the greater\nthan symbol \">\".\nprint \"hello world\" | uppercase > greetings.txt\nThis would result in changing all text to uppercase too, but instead of\nseeing \"HELLO WORLD\" on the screen weâ€™d see it in the file named\ngreetings.txt\n\nUSER INTERFACE\n\nWhile Pipes and Redirects of the Command Line are often enough. A number of\nGraphical Pipe Editors exists as well, Node-RED is a nice example.\nNode-RED[22]\n\nRECAP AND SUMMARY\n\nIn The Wizard chapter we learned not to confuse the operating system, with\nthe user interface; as those are two separate kinds of computer programs.\nNow we learn that UNIX is an operating system with a user interface\nclassified as the Command-line interface[23], let us take a closer look at\nthe command-line interface.\n\nUNIFORMITY OF COMMANDS\n\nOnce you learn the shape that a command can take, you will be able to use\nany command on any system.\nLet us proceed with an imaginary command \"print\" that has some extra\nfeatures.\n\nCOMMAND DOCUMENTATION\n\nMost well behaved commands can be executed with the --help argument, or the\n-h flag to print some helpful documentation.\nprint --help\nPopular commands will come with manual pages that can be read with the man\ncommand. In this case we would execute: man print\n\nTHE SIMPLEST FORM\n\nIn the following example there is one argument \"hello world\". Without\nquotes the command would see two arguments \"hello\" and \"world\". Quotes are\nused to join two or more things together.\nprint \"hello world\"\n\nTHE EXTENDED FORM\n\nIn the next example we have a Boolean flag \"-u\" meaning enable underline\nmode. To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have\nthe extended argument \"--format\" followed by a directive \"capitalize\".\nSupported directives can be found in documentation.\nprint -u --format capitalize \"hello world\"\nTo make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended\narguments, so --format can become -f.\nprint -u -f capitalize \"hello world\"\nConversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that\nbegins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.\nprint --underline -f capitalize \"hello world\"\nFor clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.\nprint --underline --format capitalize \"hello world\"\n\nWHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO APPLY A COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE TO SOMETHING?\n\nBecause of the uniformity of command syntax. Once you know how to run one\ncommand, you know how to run them all. You just need to pull up the\ndocumentation to see what all the commands are and what arguments they\naccept.\n\nWHAT OTHER COMPLEX SYSTEMS CAN THE COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE BE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO?\n\nAny complex system can be controlled through a command-line interface.\n\nYOUR CAR\n\nlights --highbeams on\nlights --highbeams off\ndashboard --engine-light off\nglovebox --lock passw0rd1\nglovebox --unlock passw0rd1\n\nYOUR HOUSE\n\nlights --off\nstove --off\nthermostat --heat 72\ncoffeemaker --on 6AM\n\nOFFICE SHENANIGANS\n\nPlease read github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts[24] Which \"hack\" this poor\nbastard's coffemaker, soon to be ruined romantic life, a particularly needy\ncustomer, and alcoholism. Based on a true story, apparently.\nPlease note how the community of geeks that love this story came together\nand started re-creating these \"hacker\" scripts in the programming languages\nthey favor; probably out of sadness.\nHere is the Node.js Version of fucking_coffee.js[25]. Note that once the\ntelnet connection is established at line number 22, we begin using the\ncoffeemaker command-line interface: sys brew (line 26), sys pour (line 32).\nDon't think of the coffeemaker as running UNIX, just think of it as it\nbeing controlled by a command line interface somewhere.\nAny machine with a button or two is a system with enough complexity to\nbenefit from a command-line interface.\nNote how you have never programmed a coffeemaker before, and yet you know\nprecisely - and may even remember for months to come - the commands \"sys\nbrew\" and \"sys pour\".\nsys brew\nsys pour\nIt seems sys is a single command that looks at the first text argument.\nExecuting sys -h would probably print:\nCoffemaker Help --- -h / --help print this text -v / --verbose print\ndebugging information -b / --brew / or simply brew start brewing -p /\n--pour / or simply pour start pouring -r / --reboot / or simply reboot\nreboot the system ...\nLack of proper etiquette, and using text (brew) instead of arguments\n(--brew/-b) can be an indication of sys being a script that does not take\nthe time to parse anything it just looks at the first thing after the\ncommand name. It is actually difficult to parse arguments (-b/--brew), it\ntakes no effort at all to use raw text (brew).\n\nSMART COFFEEMAKER\n\nMr. Coffee Smart Coffeemaker enabled with WeMo[26] can be controlled with the bootleg node.js client for WeMo[27] found on github. As a bonus, you can control burn down you entire house, plus the Coffeemaker.\n\nSMARTER COFFEEMAKER\n\nI was unable to locate the coffeemaker from the story. Personally I'd just\nstick a Raspberry PI[28] into a cheap one and make my own sys command\n(with proper argument parsing).\nIf you are courageous enough to do this, might as well install a small web\nserver, stream the coffeemaker[29] using the camera board module[30], and\nlet people brew you one for a small fee of $9.95[31] while you blog aboutthe experience[32] on the PI it self.\nÂ \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RPtJ9UyHS0\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuusmAGbnOo\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj4pjfU_-jo&list=PLsa31gkyINsly6N_usaeHrtDPYnwxO-1Y\n[5]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/touch.1.html\n[6]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html\n[7]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html\n[8]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mkdir.1.html\n[9]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rmdir.1.html\n[10]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mv.1.html\n[11]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rm.1.html\n[12]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/gzip\n[13]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html\n[14]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/bzip2\n[15]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wget.1.html\n[16]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/curl.1.html\n[17]: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md\n[18]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR%5C_VIDEO%5C_ID\n[19]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR%5C_VIDEO%5C_ID\n[20]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU\n[21]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg\n[22]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYreeoCoQPI\n[23]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface\n[24]: https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts\n[25]: https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/nodejs/fucking_coffee.js\n[26]: https://www.mrcoffee.com/wemo-landing-page.html\n[27]: https://github.com/timonreinhard/wemo-client\n[28]: https://www.raspberrypi.org/\n[29]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot\n[30]: https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/\n[31]: https://stripe.com/\n[32]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/",
