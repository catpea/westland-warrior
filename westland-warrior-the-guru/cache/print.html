    <h2>A Short Introduction To Commands</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">A command is a program made easy to execute. In other words by turning a
    program into a command, the programmer standardizes the execution and
    customization of the program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Usually programs need compilation, or an interpreter, they need some
    libraries. Often programs may need to be configured somehow, be it a
    configuration file, or just editing code. Programs may be hard to run,
    because every program is different.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When a programmer decides to turn his program into a command, something
    wonderful happens. The programmer adds a bunch of stuff to his program to
    make it into a command, and thus <em>standardizes</em> the way the program is ran
    and customized.</div>

    <h2>Commands At A Glance</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Here is what a command really looks like:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">command-name --some-argument value-of-the-argument</div>
  <div class="paragraph">gmail --recipient alice@aol.com --subject "I can't even!" --message "I
    can't freaking believe it, commands are cool, rawr!"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>Commands Can Do Anything</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Commands usually come in groups, for example there is a group of commands
    that manage files and directories, a group of commands that compress files,
    or download files across the internet.</div>

    <h2>File Management Commands</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Manage files and directories with <span>touch<sup>[5]</sup></span>, <span>ls<sup>[6]</sup></span>, <span>cp<sup>[7]</sup></span>, <span>mkdir<sup>[8]</sup></span>,
    <span>rmdir<sup>[9]</sup></span>, <span>mv<sup>[10]</sup></span>, and <span>rm<sup>[11]</sup></span> to name a few. If you use a file manager
    with a graphic user interface (GUI), then you don't need to worry about
    these.

  <header>
    <h2>File Download Command</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Some commands are so good at what they do there is only a couple of them
    <span>wget<sup>[15]</sup></span> and <span>curl<sup>[16]</sup></span> are a good example of that. cURL downloads files
    really well, it is also very frequently used for debugging or testing
    web-servers that serve files, it is a very efficient program. wget is
    awesome at resuming downloads and downloading large files, it actually has
    a feature that not only downloads a web page, but also all the images and
    other web pages that are linked to it.
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are also some really eyebrow raising commands like <span>youtube-dl<sup>[17]</sup></span>
    which comes with an --extract-audio argument, meaning, it will make an mp3
    out of a video.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know what Alphabet's Terms of Service state on the subject of
    downloading their data. I don't recommend you use this command, unless you
    familiarize yourself with their Terms of Service, specifics of downloading
    content with third-party tools, and own the content yourself. Note that it
    is not just a YouTube account that may get suspended, but all the rest too,
    gmail and google docs, stuff on your android phone, etc.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here is what the command would look for a YouTube Creator hoping to make a
    backup of a particular video.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">youtube-dl <span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\_VIDEO\_ID<sup>[18]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here is the code for saving just the audio it self, this is useful for
    making an audio only version of an adventure video or remixing your content
    in a song.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3
    <span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\_VIDEO\_ID<sup>[19]</sup></span>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">Look how simple and easy to read. Commands can save you from thousands of
    mouse clicks and hours of annoying, repetitive work. Commands are a
    beautiful invention. Graphic user interfaces are helpful when learning
    computers, but eventually they will force you into a world of clicks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>Commands Are Friends!</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">It is so awesome to just open a terminal, type in gmail alice@aol.com -s
    "About Cybertruck" -m "So did you get the $69K build?" and go have your
    Irish Breakfast Tea (or an Earl Gray with an extra lump of sugar and an
    extended pinkie) a whole 35 seconds earlier, because you didn't have to
    wait for the mail window to open and start sucking memory whilst inspecting
    its innards.</div>

    <h2>Simplicity Lost</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Originally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable, readable, and
    not causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are well thought out.
    But, people will cram a lot more than they should, and it gets out of
    control, here is a mild example of mixing some video files with the ffmpeg
    command.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy
    -acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have some guesses as to what the ff stands for. You can visit the manual
    page here: <span>https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg<sup>[21]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>Pipes</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a feature in the command world, that can deal with high
    complexity, and that is the pipe. Meaning two commands can be connected by
    a pipe in the following manner</div>
  <div class="paragraph">print "hello world" | uppercase</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This would result in changing all text to uppercase, and printing it on the
    screen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">HELLO WORLD</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>Redirects</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">There is also a feature of pipes that creates files and that is the greater
    than symbol "&gt;".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">print "hello world" | uppercase &gt; greetings.txt</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This would result in changing all text to uppercase too, but instead of
    seeing "HELLO WORLD" on the screen we’d see it in the file named
    greetings.txt</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>User Interface</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">While Pipes and Redirects of the Command Line are often enough. A number of
    Graphical Pipe Editors exists as well, Node-RED is a nice example.</div>

    <h2>Recap and Summary</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">In The Wizard chapter we learned not to confuse the operating system, with
    the user interface; as those are two separate kinds of computer programs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now we learn that UNIX is an operating system with a user interface
    classified as the <span>Command-line interface<sup>[23]</sup></span>, let us take a closer look at
    the command-line interface.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>Uniformity of Commands</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Once you learn the shape that a command can take, you will be able to use
    any command on any system.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Let us proceed with an imaginary command "print" that has some extra
    features.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>Command Documentation</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Most well behaved commands can be executed with the --help argument, or the
    -h flag to print some helpful documentation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">print --help</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Popular commands will come with manual pages that can be read with the man
    command. In this case we would execute: man print</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>The Simplest Form</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">In the following example there is one argument "hello world". Without
    quotes the command would see two arguments "hello" and "world". Quotes are
    used to join two or more things together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">print "hello world"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>The Extended Form</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">In the next example we have a Boolean flag "-u" meaning enable underline
    mode. To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have
    the extended argument "--format" followed by a directive "capitalize".
    Supported directives can be found in documentation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">print -u --format capitalize "hello world"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended
    arguments, so --format can become -f.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">print -u -f capitalize "hello world"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that
    begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">print --underline -f capitalize "hello world"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">print --underline --format capitalize "hello world"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>Why would anyone want to apply a Command-line interface to something?</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Because of the uniformity of command syntax. Once you know how to run one
    command, you know how to run them all. You just need to pull up the
    documentation to see what all the commands are and what arguments they
    accept.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <header>
    <h2>What other complex systems can the Command-line interface be successfully applied to?</h2>

    <h2>Office Shenanigans</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Please read <span>github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts<sup>[24]</sup></span> Which "hack" this poor
    bastard's coffemaker, soon to be ruined romantic life, a particularly needy
    customer, and alcoholism. Based on a true story, apparently.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Please note how the community of geeks that love this story came together
    and started re-creating these "hacker" scripts in the programming languages
    they favor; probably out of sadness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here is the Node.js Version of <span>fucking_coffee.js<sup>[25]</sup></span>. Note that once the
    telnet connection is established at line number 22, we begin using the
    coffeemaker command-line interface: sys brew (line 26), sys pour (line 32).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't think of the coffeemaker as running UNIX, just think of it as it
    being controlled by a command line interface somewhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Any machine with a button or two is a system with enough complexity to
    benefit from a command-line interface.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Note how you have never programmed a coffeemaker before, and yet you know
    precisely - and may even remember for months to come - the commands "sys
    brew" and "sys pour".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sys brew</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sys pour</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It seems sys is a single command that looks at the first text argument.
    Executing sys -h would probably print:</div>
  <div class="paragraph"> Coffemaker Help ---- -h / --help print this text -v / --verbose print
    debugging information -b / --brew / or simply brew start brewing -p /
    --pour / or simply pour start pouring -r / --reboot / or simply reboot
    reboot the system ... </div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of proper etiquette, and using text (brew) instead of arguments
    (--brew/-b) can be an indication of sys being a script that does not take
    the time to parse anything it just looks at the first thing after the
    command name. It is actually difficult to parse arguments (-b/--brew), it
    takes no effort at all to use raw text (brew).</div>
