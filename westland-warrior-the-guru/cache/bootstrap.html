    <h5 class="card-title">A Short Introduction To Commands</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>A command is a program made easy to execute. In other words by turning a
        program into a command, the programmer standardizes the execution and
        customization of the program.</p>
      <p>Usually programs need compilation, or an interpreter, they need some
        libraries. Often programs may need to be configured somehow, be it a
        configuration file, or just editing code. Programs may be hard to run,
        because every program is different.</p>
      <p>When a programmer decides to turn his program into a command, something
        wonderful happens. The programmer adds a bunch of stuff to his program to
        make it into a command, and thus <em>standardizes</em> the way the program is ran
        and customized.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">File Download Command</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Some commands are so good at what they do there is only a couple of them
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wget.1.html">wget</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/curl.1.html">curl</a> are a good example of that. cURL downloads files
        really well, it is also very frequently used for debugging or testing
        web-servers that serve files, it is a very efficient program. wget is
        awesome at resuming downloads and downloading large files, it actually has
        a feature that not only downloads a web page, but also all the images and
        other web pages that are linked to it.
      </p>
      <p>There are also some really eyebrow raising commands like <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md">youtube-dl</a>
        which comes with an --extract-audio argument, meaning, it will make an mp3
        out of a video.</p>
      <p>I don&#39;t know what Alphabet&#39;s Terms of Service state on the subject of
        downloading their data. I don&#39;t recommend you use this command, unless you
        familiarize yourself with their Terms of Service, specifics of downloading
        content with third-party tools, and own the content yourself. Note that it
        is not just a YouTube account that may get suspended, but all the rest too,
        gmail and google docs, stuff on your android phone, etc.</p>
      <p>Here is what the command would look for a YouTube Creator hoping to make a
        backup of a particular video.</p>
      <p>youtube-dl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR%5C_VIDEO%5C_ID">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\_VIDEO\_ID</a></p>
      <p>And here is the code for saving just the audio it self, this is useful for
        making an audio only version of an adventure video or remixing your content
        in a song.</p>
      <p>youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR%5C_VIDEO%5C_ID">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\_VIDEO\_ID</a>
      </p>
      <p>Look how simple and easy to read. Commands can save you from thousands of
        mouse clicks and hours of annoying, repetitive work. Commands are a
        beautiful invention. Graphic user interfaces are helpful when learning
        computers, but eventually they will force you into a world of clicks.</p>

      <p>Originally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable, readable, and
        not causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are well thought out.
        But, people will cram a lot more than they should, and it gets out of
        control, here is a mild example of mixing some video files with the ffmpeg
        command.</p>
      <p>ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy
        -acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">The Simplest Form</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>In the following example there is one argument &quot;hello world&quot;. Without
        quotes the command would see two arguments &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot;. Quotes are
        used to join two or more things together.</p>
      <p>print &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
    </div>

</div>
<div class="card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">The Extended Form</h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>In the next example we have a Boolean flag &quot;-u&quot; meaning enable underline
        mode. To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have
        the extended argument &quot;--format&quot; followed by a directive &quot;capitalize&quot;.
        Supported directives can be found in documentation.</p>
      <p>print -u --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
      <p>To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended
        arguments, so --format can become -f.</p>
      <p>print -u -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
      <p>Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that
        begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.</p>
      <p>print --underline -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
      <p>For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.</p>
      <p>print --underline --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>

      <p>Please read <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts">github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts</a> Which &quot;hack&quot; this poor
        bastard&#39;s coffemaker, soon to be ruined romantic life, a particularly needy
        customer, and alcoholism. Based on a true story, apparently.</p>
      <p>Please note how the community of geeks that love this story came together
        and started re-creating these &quot;hacker&quot; scripts in the programming languages
        they favor; probably out of sadness.</p>
      <p>Here is the Node.js Version of <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/nodejs/fucking_coffee.js">fucking_coffee.js</a>. Note that once the
        telnet connection is established at line number 22, we begin using the
        coffeemaker command-line interface: sys brew (line 26), sys pour (line 32).</p>
      <p>Don&#39;t think of the coffeemaker as running UNIX, just think of it as it
        being controlled by a command line interface somewhere.</p>
      <p>Any machine with a button or two is a system with enough complexity to
        benefit from a command-line interface.</p>
      <p>Note how you have never programmed a coffeemaker before, and yet you know
        precisely - and may even remember for months to come - the commands &quot;sys
        brew&quot; and &quot;sys pour&quot;.</p>
      <p>sys brew</p>
      <p>sys pour</p>
      <p>It seems sys is a single command that looks at the first text argument.
        Executing sys -h would probably print:</p>
      <p> Coffemaker Help ---- -h / --help print this text -v / --verbose print
        debugging information -b / --brew / or simply brew start brewing -p /
        --pour / or simply pour start pouring -r / --reboot / or simply reboot
        reboot the system ... </p>
      <p>Lack of proper etiquette, and using text (brew) instead of arguments
        (--brew/-b) can be an indication of sys being a script that does not take
        the time to parse anything it just looks at the first thing after the
        command name. It is actually difficult to parse arguments (-b/--brew), it
        takes no effort at all to use raw text (brew).</p>
