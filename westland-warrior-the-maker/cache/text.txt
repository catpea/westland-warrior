BUSINESS PRACTICE: PONOKO CLOCKS

Thinking flat is about simplicity, and sometimes layers. In 3D Printing we
think in layers of plastic; in Laser Cutting we can think in layers of
whatever you are cutting.

BUSINESS PRACTICE: PONOKO CASES

A great example of flat layers adding up to create more than just flat
thing are Raspberry PI cases.

BUSINESS PRACTICE: WALLETS

A good example of a flat cut product that makes good money, is the wallet!
Kickstarter[26] has an article about wallets Why are there so many wallets on Kickstarter?[27] Take a look at Trayvax[28] and Dango Products[29] for more ideas.
