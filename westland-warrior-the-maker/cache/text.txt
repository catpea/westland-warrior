Thinking flat is about simplicity, and sometimes layers. In 3D Printing we
think in layers of plastic; in Laser Cutting we can think in layers of
whatever you are cutting.

Business Practice: Ponoko Cases

A great example of flat layers adding up to create more than just flat
thing are Raspberry PI cases.

Business Practice: Wallets

A good example of a flat cut product that makes good money, is the wallet!
Kickstarter has an article about wallets Why are there so many wallets on Kickstarter? Take a look at Trayvax and Dango Products for more ideas.
