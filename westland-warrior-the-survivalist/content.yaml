    I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only
    the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to
    teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did
    not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to
    practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep
    and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like
    as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave
    close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...
