Quote by Henry David Thoreau

I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front onlythe essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had toteach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I didnot wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish topractice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deepand suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-likeas to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shaveclose, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...

Henry David Thoreau
