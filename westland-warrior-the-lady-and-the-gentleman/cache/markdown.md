The Lady and The Gentleman

Inside Out
----------

There is no force in the universe that can help a person grow up outside  
in. In education, the idea of dividing all subjects into tidy categories  
that make perfect sense takes away from beauty of Knowledge. Coupled with  
the misunderstanding that we can be taught by being talked at, school can  
only become an exercise in memorization. A school may make a diploma, but  
it cannot make a grown-up.

Authenticity
------------

Gentlemen emerged from Knights, inheriting the philosophies of Knightly  
Virtues. I am sure every fool, wealthy or poor, tried to call him self a  
gentleman, but I think back then people paid attention to such claims.

The ease with which we accept lies from people of authority today. Would  
not be present had the virtues still mattered to an overwhelming majority.

Your Move Chief

Forbearance and Largesse
------------------------

Character of Dr. Sean Maguire as portrayed by Robin Williams is a fine  
example of a modern gentleman with class, integrity, and authenticity.

Definition
----------

My definition of a Lady/Gentlelady, or a Gentleman: A person ennobled by  
her deeds.

More specifically, the _sum of intent across a person's entire history._

The one lesson that I loved in High School. A Gentleman, an English Teacher  
reminding us: "The choices you make today, dictate the life ahead of you.".

And it is those same choices, that will describe who you really are, come a  
decade or two from now. Therefore, choose wholeheartedly, beautifully,  
heroically, always rising and growing up. Make the choices that the older  
you won't regret.

Choices
-------

My friends,

Choose Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.

Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage, Love; and  
Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism.

Speed Thou Slowly
-----------------

Life is the single most complex adventure you will face, take the long  
roads. Choose Books, Audiobooks, and inherit as much wisdom from all the  
great beings as you can.
