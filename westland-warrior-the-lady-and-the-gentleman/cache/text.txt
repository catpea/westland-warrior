Quote by Edmund Burke

A King may make a Nobleman but he cannot make Gentleman.

Edmund Burke

The Lady and The Gentleman

Inside Out

There is no force in the universe that can help a person grow up outsidein. In education, the idea of dividing all subjects into tidy categoriesthat make perfect sense takes away from beauty of Knowledge. Coupled withthe misunderstanding that we can be taught by being talked at, school canonly become an exercise in memorization. A school may make a diploma, butit cannot make a grown-up.

Doubt

Authenticity

Gentlemen emerged from Knights, inheriting the philosophies of KnightlyVirtues. I am sure every fool, wealthy or poor, tried to call him self agentleman, but I think back then people paid attention to such claims.
The ease with which we accept lies from people of authority today. Wouldnot be present had the virtues still mattered to an overwhelming majority.

Your Move Chief

Forbearance and Largesse

Character of Dr. Sean Maguire as portrayed by Robin Williams is a fineexample of a modern gentleman with class, integrity, and authenticity.

Why Chivalry Still has a Chance by Anthony Rudolf

Definition

My definition of a Lady/Gentlelady, or a Gentleman: A person ennobled byher deeds.
More specifically, the sum of intent across a person's entire history.
The one lesson that I loved in High School. A Gentleman, an English Teacherreminding us: "The choices you make today, dictate the life ahead of you.".
And it is those same choices, that will describe who you really are, come adecade or two from now. Therefore, choose wholeheartedly, beautifully,heroically, always rising and growing up. Make the choices that the olderyou won't regret.

A Wanderer Ennobled By His Deeds

Choices

My friends,
Choose Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.
Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage, Love; andInsight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism.

Speed Thou Slowly

Life is the single most complex adventure you will face, take the longroads. Choose Books, Audiobooks, and inherit as much wisdom from all thegreat beings as you can.
