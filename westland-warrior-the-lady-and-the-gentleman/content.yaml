    There is no force in the universe that can help a person grow up outside
    in. In education, the idea of dividing all subjects into tidy categories
    that make perfect sense takes away from beauty of Knowledge. Coupled with
    the misunderstanding that we can be taught by being talked at, school can
    only become an exercise in memorization. A school may make a diploma, but
    it cannot make a grown-up.

    Gentlemen emerged from Knights, inheriting the philosophies of Knightly
    Virtues. I am sure every fool, wealthy or poor, tried to call him self a
    gentleman, but I think back then people paid attention to such claims.

    The ease with which we accept lies from people of authority today. Would
    not be present had the virtues still mattered to an overwhelming majority.

  title: Definition
  text: |-
    My definition of a Lady/Gentlelady, or a Gentleman: A person ennobled by
    her deeds.

    More specifically, the _sum of intent across a person's entire history._

    The one lesson that I loved in High School. A Gentleman, an English Teacher
    reminding us: "The choices you make today, dictate the life ahead of you.".

    And it is those same choices, that will describe who you really are, come a
    decade or two from now. Therefore, choose wholeheartedly, beautifully,
    heroically, always rising and growing up. Make the choices that the older
    you won't regret.

    My friends,

    Choose Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.

    Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage, Love; and
    Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism.

    Life is the single most complex adventure you will face, take the long
    roads. Choose Books, Audiobooks, and inherit as much wisdom from all the
    great beings as you can.
