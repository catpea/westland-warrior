  "text": "PHILOSOPHY\n\nPhilosophy[1] (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally “love of wisdom”) is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophia has been called The Mother of All Sciences.\n\nEDUCATION SYSTEMS\n\nSir Ken Robinson, in his “How to escape education’s death valley” states\nthat the more successful Alternative Education Systems should become the\nnorm, because they are clearly more successful.\nHow to escape education's death valley by Sir Ken Robinson[2]\n\nEXTREME OWNERSHIP\n\nI think that some day we maybe able to find great schools, and people like\nSir Robinson will help that day come. But it will be too little too late,\ncertainly for us. In this final chapter I will ask you to take Extreme\nOwnership of Your Education, and here is Jocko Willink explaining the\ngravity of the words Extreme Ownership.\nExtreme Ownership by Jocko Willink[3]\n\nEXTREME OWNERSHIP\n\nExtreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means Self Education. It\nmeans learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence that\nmatches you the best. This is also the meaning of the opening quote by Sun\nTzu “Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated\nwarriors go to war first and then seek to win.”\nEducation is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing up, it\nis about being healthy, and strong. Regardless of where you are headed,\nwhether or not that direction includes Medical School, or a University. You\nneed to Self Educate before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroom\nmay not be the place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.\nSetting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many years, or\neven decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can fit in a\nsentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable Zizek![4],\nExamined Life[5], and now Democracy[6] further explains, and I think\nserves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.\nAstra Taylor on the Unschooled Life[7]\n\nSCIENCE POPULARIZERS\n\nThe beginning of self education starts with a class of teachers often\ncalled Science Popularizers. They don’t just teach science, but also\nrestore the connecting lines between all the Daughters of Philosophia,\nlines lost due to the bleaching effect that categorization of knowledge,\nstandardization of sequence of learning, and standardized testing causes.\nThe Storytelling of Science is a good overview of who these teachers are,\nhow they think, of their energy and class.\nThe Great Debate: THE STORYTELLING OF SCIENCE, part 1 of 2[8]\nThe Great Debate: THE STORYTELLING OF SCIENCEi, part 2 of 2[9]\n\nSELF EDUCATION\n\nEducation is simply too important to be put in someone else’s hands. It is\nyour mind, your life, your growing up, your own responsibility. Above all,\nyour body of knowledge has massive infuence over your private\ndecision-making, over your freedom of choice, over your freedom of will.\nDecision-making is one of the most sacred things in life, and only you\nshould have control over that.\nI urge you to forget the idea that you must be taught to learn. I urge you\nto accept that great responsibility yourself. You must take extreme\nownership of your own Self Education.\nWe Are All Connected[10]\n\nBILL BRYSON\n\nTalking Science: Bill Bryson on A Short History of Nearly Everything[11]\n\nBILL BRYSON\n\nA Short History of Nearly Everything[12] Audiobook. The Body[13] (His latest book). All of Bryson’s Audiobooks[14].\n\nHOWARD ZINN\n\nHoward Zinn: A People's History of the United States (1999)[15]\n\nA PEOPLE’S HISTORY\n\nAudiobook version of A People’s History of the United States[16] is 34 hrs and 8 mins long.\nAbridged version (8 hrs and 44 mins ) read by Matt Damon is here: APeople’s History of the United States[17]\n\nSTOICISM\n\nThe philosophy of Stoicism by Massimo Pigliucci[18]\n\nCRASH COURSE PHILOSOPHY\n\n47 Video YouTube Playlist[19]\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX78iKhInsc\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyG430I2nk\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwmum5_ofU\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxRj9JWQMs\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwIyy1Fi-4Q\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4QPz52Sfo\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40YIIaF1qiw\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gb-hnbHbjw\n[12]: https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW\n[13]: https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Body-Audiobook/0147526922\n[14]: https://www.audible.com/author/Bill-Bryson/B000APXTVM\n[15]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn_m9WCd-88\n[16]: https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Peoples-History-of-the-United-States-Audiobook/B0030H777E\n[17]: https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Peoples-History-of-the-United-States-Audiobook/B002V5CKGE\n[18]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OCA6UFE-0\n[19]: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR",
