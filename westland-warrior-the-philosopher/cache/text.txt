Sir Ken Robinson, in his “How to escape education’s death valley” statesthat the more successful Alternative Education Systems should become thenorm, because they are clearly more successful.

Extreme Ownership

I think that some day we maybe able to find great schools, and people likeSir Robinson will help that day come. But it will be too little too late,certainly for us. In this final chapter I will ask you to take ExtremeOwnership of Your Education, and here is Jocko Willink explaining thegravity of the words Extreme Ownership.

Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink

Extreme Ownership

Extreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means Self Education. Itmeans learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence thatmatches you the best. This is also the meaning of the opening quote by SunTzu “Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeatedwarriors go to war first and then seek to win.”
Education is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing up, itis about being healthy, and strong. Regardless of where you are headed,whether or not that direction includes Medical School, or a University. Youneed to Self Educate before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroommay not be the place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.
Setting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many years, oreven decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can fit in asentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable Zizek!,Examined Life, and now Democracy further explains, and I thinkserves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.

Science Popularizers

The beginning of self education starts with a class of teachers oftencalled Science Popularizers. They don’t just teach science, but alsorestore the connecting lines between all the Daughters of Philosophia,lines lost due to the bleaching effect that categorization of knowledge,standardization of sequence of learning, and standardized testing causes.
The Storytelling of Science is a good overview of who these teachers are,how they think, of their energy and class.

Self Education

Education is simply too important to be put in someone else’s hands. It isyour mind, your life, your growing up, your own responsibility. Above all,your body of knowledge has massive infuence over your privatedecision-making, over your freedom of choice, over your freedom of will.Decision-making is one of the most sacred things in life, and only youshould have control over that.
I urge you to forget the idea that you must be taught to learn. I urge youto accept that great responsibility yourself. You must take extremeownership of your own Self Education.
