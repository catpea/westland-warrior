    Where did I learn to understand sculpture? In the woods by looking at the
    trees, along roads by observing the formation of clouds, in the studio by
    studying the model, everywhere except in the schools.

    [Sell][1] your 3D models through Printing on Demand (POD, printing only when someone pays for your product) at [Shapeways][2] and similar 3d print shops. Shapeways created [shapejs][3] a programmable product creator with many [examples in JavaScript][4], this can be used to generate a large number of unique products (antique coin pendants, tiny statues of art in public domain, odd bobble heads, skeleton wallets, waveform rings, UPC/QR code bracelets or keychain doodads.).
