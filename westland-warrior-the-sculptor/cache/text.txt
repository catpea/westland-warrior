BUSINESS PRACTICE: SHAPEWAYS LASER PRINTING

Sell[21] your 3D models through Printing on Demand (POD, printing only when someone pays for your product) at Shapeways[22] and similar 3d print shops. Shapeways created shapejs[23] a programmable product creator with many examples in JavaScript[24], this can be used to generate a large number of unique products (antique coin pendants, tiny statues of art in public domain, odd bobble heads, skeleton wallets, waveform rings, UPC/QR code bracelets or keychain doodads.).

BUSINESS PRACTICE: SCANNED MODEL SALES

You are not limited to digital models, you can experiment with 3dscanners[25] as well. Take a look at the Shapeways Marketplace[26] for
more ideas.
