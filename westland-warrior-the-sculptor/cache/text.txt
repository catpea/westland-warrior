Quote by Auguste Rodin

Where did I learn to understand sculpture? In the woods by looking at the
trees, along roads by observing the formation of clouds, in the studio by
studying the model, everywhere except in the schools.

Business Practice: Shapeways Laser Printing

Sell your 3D models through Printing on Demand (POD, printing only when someone pays for your product) at Shapeways and similar 3d print shops. Shapeways created shapejs a programmable product creator with many examples in JavaScript, this can be used to generate a large number of unique products (antique coin pendants, tiny statues of art in public domain, odd bobble heads, skeleton wallets, waveform rings, UPC/QR code bracelets or keychain doodads.).

Business Practice: Scanned Model Sales

You are not limited to digital models, you can experiment with 3d
scanners as well. Take a look at the Shapeways Marketplace for
more ideas.
