  title: Problems with non Cut & Sew
  text: |-
    Below is a picture of why you must choose the Cut & Sew method. The
    printing process on pre-made garments is flawed, the gas will not permeate
    wrinkles that are sure to occur on pre-made garments. You must first create
    the fabric, and then Cut & Sew the garment. Take a look at the [source
    video][1] that demonstrates the problem with sublimating pre-made garments
    in a bit more detail.
