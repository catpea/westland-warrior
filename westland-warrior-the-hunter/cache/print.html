  <div class="paragraph">Just from this overview alone, you get the picture of how capable we are,<br>how noble, how unbreakable, how magnificent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting<br>without spears.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that’s out optimal diet, the nutrients that<br>we evolved to require for our optimal health.</div>

    <h2>Quo Vadis?</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">My Grandma taught me to ask "Quo Vadis?" it is from Latin, it means<br>"Whither goest thou?" or "Where are you going?".</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At 3:41 the brave mercenary describes himself as someone who was<br>"Programmed to Destroy". While he was growing in his wisdom, he perceived<br>the lack of it, as "being programmed". There is an old saying "A learned<br>servant is not a useful servant", wisdom set Mr. Mander free.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Quo Vadis? is a repeating decision making pattern among the great beings.<br>Mr. Mander in what he calls his "True Act of Bravery" (3:49). Uses it to<br>"ensure [that] there'll never be separation between who I am, and what I<br>do", to ensure his Authenticity, Harmony, Dignity, Integrity, Sanity. He<br>also asks "Quo Vadis?" in the larger question surrounding both "Does that<br>elephant need its face more than some guy in Asia needs a tusk on his<br>desk?" and "Would I be brave enough to give up everything in my life to try<br>and stop the suffering of animals". The result of these Authentic Brave<br>Queries is the <span>International Anti-Poaching Foundation<sup>[6]</sup></span>. From Mercenary,<br>to a Warrior, a Legend, a Great Being.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lucy Hone is yet another Great Being who employs this type of thinking<br>especially when asking "Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?" see<br>Superhero Chapter for her advice on the subject of Unbrekability and<br>Resilience.</div>
