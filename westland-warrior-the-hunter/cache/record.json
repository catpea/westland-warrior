  "text": "The Bear Hunt\n\nThis artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it in\na book entitled “Wszechświat życie człowiek” (Universe, Life, Human) and\none of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as good\nA Short History of Nearly Everything which is available as an\nAudiobook where he gently talks about learning, and what he learned\nabout our universe.\n\nNatural Born Athletes\n\nWe can infer some really important facts about who we are based on where we\ncome from, we can even imagine the diet we evolved alongside with.\nIt is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chase\nanimals to death in an act called Endurance Hunting\n\nHuman Mammal, Human Hunter, Attenborough, Life of Mammals\n\nHuman Mammal, Human Hunter, Attenborough, Life of Mammals\n\nProtect Life\n\nJust from this overview alone, you get the picture of how capable we are,\nhow noble, how unbreakable, how magnificent.\nWe have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting\nwithout spears.\nWe did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.\nWe are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.\nWe ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that’s out optimal diet, the nutrients that\nwe evolved to require for our optimal health.\n\nModern Warrior: Damien Mander\n\nModern Warrior: Damien Mander\n\nQuo Vadis?\n\nMy Grandma taught me to ask \"Quo Vadis?\" it is from Latin, it means\n\"Whither goest thou?\" or \"Where are you going?\".\nAt 3:41 the brave mercenary describes himself as someone who was\n\"Programmed to Destroy\". While he was growing in his wisdom, he perceived\nthe lack of it, as \"being programmed\". There is an old saying \"A learned\nservant is not a useful servant\", wisdom set Mr. Mander free.\nQuo Vadis? is a repeating decision making pattern among the great beings.\nMr. Mander in what he calls his \"True Act of Bravery\" (3:49). Uses it to\n\"ensure [that] there'll never be separation between who I am, and what I\ndo\", to ensure his Authenticity, Harmony, Dignity, Integrity, Sanity. He\nalso asks \"Quo Vadis?\" in the larger question surrounding both \"Does that\nelephant need its face more than some guy in Asia needs a tusk on his\ndesk?\" and \"Would I be brave enough to give up everything in my life to try\nand stop the suffering of animals\". The result of these Authentic Brave\nQueries is the International Anti-Poaching Foundation.
