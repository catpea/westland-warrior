  <p>This artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it in
    a book entitled “Wszechświat życie człowiek” (Universe, Life, Human) and
    one of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as good
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a> which is available as an
    <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW">Audiobook</a> where he gently talks about learning, and what he learned
    about our universe.

  <p>We can infer some really important facts about who we are based on where we
    come from, we can even imagine the diet we evolved alongside with.</p>
  <p>It is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chase
    animals to death in an act called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting">Endurance Hunting</a></p>

    <h2>Protect Life</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Just from this overview alone, you get the picture of how capable we are,
    how noble, how unbreakable, how magnificent.</p>
  <p>We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting
    without spears.</p>
  <p>We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.</p>
  <p>We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.</p>
  <p>We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that’s out optimal diet, the nutrients that
    we evolved to require for our optimal health.</p>

    <h2>Quo Vadis?</h2>
  </header>
  <p>My Grandma taught me to ask &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; it is from Latin, it means
    &quot;Whither goest thou?&quot; or &quot;Where are you going?&quot;.</p>
  <p>At 3:41 the brave mercenary describes himself as someone who was
    &quot;Programmed to Destroy&quot;. While he was growing in his wisdom, he perceived
    the lack of it, as &quot;being programmed&quot;. There is an old saying &quot;A learned
    servant is not a useful servant&quot;, wisdom set Mr. Mander free.</p>
  <p>Quo Vadis? is a repeating decision making pattern among the great beings.
    Mr. Mander in what he calls his &quot;True Act of Bravery&quot; (3:49). Uses it to
    &quot;ensure [that] there&#39;ll never be separation between who I am, and what I
    do&quot;, to ensure his Authenticity, Harmony, Dignity, Integrity, Sanity. He
    also asks &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; in the larger question surrounding both &quot;Does that
    elephant need its face more than some guy in Asia needs a tusk on his
    desk?&quot; and &quot;Would I be brave enough to give up everything in my life to try
    and stop the suffering of animals&quot;. The result of these Authentic Brave
    Queries is the <a href="https://www.iapf.org/">International Anti-Poaching Foundation</a>. From Mercenary,
    to a Warrior, a Legend, a Great Being.</p>
  <p>Lucy Hone is yet another Great Being who employs this type of thinking
    especially when asking &quot;Is what I&#39;m doing helping or harming me?&quot; see
    Superhero Chapter for her advice on the subject of Unbrekability and
    Resilience.</p>

  <p>We belong in communities, not to live in isolation.</p>
  <p>We grew up protecting each other, casting out those who stand in the way of
    future generations, looking after the little ones so that they may grow to
    become great hunters.</p>
