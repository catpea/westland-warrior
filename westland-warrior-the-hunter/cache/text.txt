The Bear Hunt

This artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it in
a book entitled “Wszechświat życie człowiek” (Universe, Life, Human) and
one of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as good
A Short History of Nearly Everything which is available as an
Audiobook where he gently talks about learning, and what he learned
about our universe.

Natural Born Athletes

We can infer some really important facts about who we are based on where we
come from, we can even imagine the diet we evolved alongside with.
It is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chase
animals to death in an act called Endurance Hunting

Human Mammal, Human Hunter, Attenborough, Life of Mammals

Protect Life

Just from this overview alone, you get the picture of how capable we are,
how noble, how unbreakable, how magnificent.
We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting
without spears.
We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.
We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.
We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that’s out optimal diet, the nutrients that
we evolved to require for our optimal health.

Modern Warrior: Damien Mander

Quo Vadis?

My Grandma taught me to ask "Quo Vadis?" it is from Latin, it means
"Whither goest thou?" or "Where are you going?".
At 3:41 the brave mercenary describes himself as someone who was
"Programmed to Destroy". While he was growing in his wisdom, he perceived
the lack of it, as "being programmed". There is an old saying "A learned
servant is not a useful servant", wisdom set Mr. Mander free.
Quo Vadis? is a repeating decision making pattern among the great beings.
Mr. Mander in what he calls his "True Act of Bravery" (3:49). Uses it to
"ensure [that] there'll never be separation between who I am, and what I
do", to ensure his Authenticity, Harmony, Dignity, Integrity, Sanity. He
also asks "Quo Vadis?" in the larger question surrounding both "Does that
elephant need its face more than some guy in Asia needs a tusk on his
desk?" and "Would I be brave enough to give up everything in my life to try
and stop the suffering of animals". The result of these Authentic Brave
Queries is the International Anti-Poaching Foundation. From Mercenary,
to a Warrior, a Legend, a Great Being.
Lucy Hone is yet another Great Being who employs this type of thinking
especially when asking "Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?" see
Superhero Chapter for her advice on the subject of Unbrekability and
Resilience.

One Family

We belong in communities, not to live in isolation.
We grew up protecting each other, casting out those who stand in the way of
future generations, looking after the little ones so that they may grow to
become great hunters.
