The Bear Hunt

This artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it ina book entitled “Wszechświat życie człowiek” (Universe, Life, Human) andone of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as goodA Short History of Nearly Everything which is available as anAudiobook where he gently talks about learning, and what he learnedabout our universe.

Natural Born Athletes

We can infer some really important facts about who we are based on where wecome from, we can even imagine the diet we evolved alongside with.
It is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chaseanimals to death in an act called Endurance Hunting

Protect Life

Just from this overview alone, you get the picture of how capable we are,how noble, how unbreakable, how magnificent.
We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well huntingwithout spears.
We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.
We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.
We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that’s out optimal diet, the nutrients thatwe evolved to require for our optimal health.

Modern Warrior: Damien Mander

Quo Vadis?

My Grandma taught me to ask "Quo Vadis?" it is from Latin, it means"Whither goest thou?" or "Where are you going?".
At 3:41 the brave mercenary describes himself as someone who was"Programmed to Destroy". While he was growing in his wisdom, he perceivedthe lack of it, as "being programmed". There is an old saying "A learnedservant is not a useful servant", wisdom set Mr. Mander free.
Quo Vadis? is a repeating decision making pattern among the great beings.Mr. Mander in what he calls his "True Act of Bravery" (3:49). Uses it to"ensure [that] there'll never be separation between who I am, and what Ido", to ensure his Authenticity, Harmony, Dignity, Integrity, Sanity. Healso asks "Quo Vadis?" in the larger question surrounding both "Does thatelephant need its face more than some guy in Asia needs a tusk on hisdesk?" and "Would I be brave enough to give up everything in my life to tryand stop the suffering of animals". The result of these Authentic BraveQueries is the International Anti-Poaching Foundation. From Mercenary,to a Warrior, a Legend, a Great Being.
Lucy Hone is yet another Great Being who employs this type of thinkingespecially when asking "Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?" seeSuperhero Chapter for her advice on the subject of Unbrekability andResilience.

One Family

We belong in communities, not to live in isolation.
We grew up protecting each other, casting out those who stand in the way offuture generations, looking after the little ones so that they may grow tobecome great hunters.
