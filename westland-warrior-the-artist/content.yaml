    Tracing paper does not need batteries, just a pencil.

    Anybody can trace a printout of something they like with tracing paper.
    What many don't understand is that after tracing, you need to black out the
    opposite side of your trace to create a home made, Transfer Paper.

    On the front you have your trace. On the back you deposit as much graphite
    as needed.

    Then you place your trace on proper Drawing Paper. Then, go over your trace
    one more time, the graphite on the back will now transfer to your drawing
    paper.

    By blacking out the back of your trace you create Graphite Paper.

    You can skip this step by buying pre-made Graphite Paper. (Pre-made
    Graphite Paper is a **lot** darker and sharper. If you trace something that
    has a lot of small details, you should use Graphite Paper.)

    Now you will place Graphite Paper over your Drawing paper, and then put
    your trace on top, and then go over it with a pencil.

    Lightbox will help you with tracing and creation of new designs.

    A light box is an interesting addition to the process of tracing, it does
    need batteries, or a USB port. When buying an inexpensive light box ($25),
    you might want to consider getting a tiny battery powered [projector][1]
    ($75) as well.

    You can take a selfie, connect your phone to the projector, and begin
    painting.

    Even better you can connect your Raspberry PI, or Laptop and use a program
    like [GIMP][1] where you can manipulate your source material to reveal
    edges, colors, or adjust contrast while painting to reveal the brightest
    parts of your source material.

    Tip: Consider putting registration marks in your image and on your canvas,
    it is easier to resume your work after you bump the projector or call it a
    night.

    Idea: Record your painting progress and upload a sped up movie to YouTube.

    "I'm a professional graphic designer and illustrator with a soft spot for
    fur kids. I've always loved painting and drawing animals. Our pets are like
    family, and I truly enjoy working on tributes to these silly, lovable,
    trusting and loyal creatures. In addition to Bri Pet Portraits, I am also
    on Etsy under the shop Bri Baby Art - a shop featuring custom artworks for
    nurseries and kids room decor." (from [BriPetPortraits on Etsy][1])

    Custom Pet Portraits. Online business where people upload an image, and you
    create a large canvas painting, or drawing. It looks like the price is
    about $50 per portrait. Throw in a bonus, record a time lapse video of the
    painting for advertising, portfolio, and internet points.

    If you are going to draw with pencils make sure to use blending stumps and
    smudge the graphite to give it a photo-realistic look. Get an [art
    board][1], Drawing Paper (not Sketching Paper), [tin of pencils][2],
    battery powered eraser and eraser shield, and head for the [DIA][3], or a
    Museum, or even a Coffee Shop.
