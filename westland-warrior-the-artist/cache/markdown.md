Tracing Paper
-------------

Tracing paper does not need batteries, just a pencil.

Anybody can trace a printout of something they like with tracing paper.  
What many don't understand is that after tracing, you need to black out the  
opposite side of your trace to create a home made, Transfer Paper.

Tracing Paper
-------------

On the front you have your trace. On the back you deposit as much graphite  
as needed.

Then you place your trace on proper Drawing Paper. Then, go over your trace  
one more time, the graphite on the back will now transfer to your drawing  
paper.

Graphite Paper
--------------

![Graphite Paper](/image/graphite-paper.jpg)

By blacking out the back of your trace you create Graphite Paper.

You can skip this step by buying pre-made Graphite Paper. (Pre-made  
Graphite Paper is a **lot** darker and sharper. If you trace something that  
has a lot of small details, you should use Graphite Paper.)

Now you will place Graphite Paper over your Drawing paper, and then put  
your trace on top, and then go over it with a pencil.

Light Box
---------

Lightbox will help you with tracing and creation of new designs.

A light box is an interesting addition to the process of tracing, it does  
need batteries, or a USB port. When buying an inexpensive light box ($25),  
you might want to consider getting a tiny battery powered [projector](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Mini+Projector&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)  
($75) as well.

Digital Projector
-----------------

![Digital Projector](/image/projector-phone.jpg)

You can take a selfie, connect your phone to the projector, and begin  
painting.

Even better you can connect your Raspberry PI, or Laptop and use a program  
like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) where you can manipulate your source material to reveal  
edges, colors, or adjust contrast while painting to reveal the brightest  
parts of your source material.

Tip: Consider putting registration marks in your image and on your canvas,  
it is easier to resume your work after you bump the projector or call it a  
night.

Idea: Record your painting progress and upload a sped up movie to YouTube.

"I'm a professional graphic designer and illustrator with a soft spot for  
fur kids. I've always loved painting and drawing animals. Our pets are like  
family, and I truly enjoy working on tributes to these silly, lovable,  
trusting and loyal creatures. In addition to Bri Pet Portraits, I am also  
on Etsy under the shop Bri Baby Art - a shop featuring custom artworks for  
nurseries and kids room decor." (from [BriPetPortraits on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/BriPetPortraits))

create a large canvas painting, or drawing. It looks like the price is  
about $50 per portrait. Throw in a bonus, record a time lapse video of the

Please, never draw alone.
-------------------------

If you are going to draw with pencils make sure to use blending stumps and  
smudge the graphite to give it a photo-realistic look. Get an [art  
board](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Darts-crafts&field-keywords=Sketch+Tote+Drawing+), Drawing Paper (not Sketching Paper), [tin of pencils](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Doffice-products&field-keywords=Staedtler+Lumograph+Graphite+Drawing),  
battery powered eraser and eraser shield, and head for the [DIA](https://www.dia.org/), or a  
Museum, or even a Coffee Shop.
