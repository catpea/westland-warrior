What is a Hacker? with Emmanuel Goldstein.

Kids hack their Dad's computer on her Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi

The $35 Raspberry Pi is the most handsome in a class of computerscalled Single-board computers. They just released version 4, so makesure you get that one; and don’t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell thePI, packaged in the Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit. Personally, I thinkgetting the original keyboard and mouse is really cool, I am not a fan ofthe plastic case and would go for a cool looking Heat Sink “Case” -and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a twopart review of all the popular cases here you go: Part 1 and Part2. Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd Britishphrases.

Raspberry Pi 4

What's inside the Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit?

Portable Monitor

Monitors

There is a class of monitors called Portable Monitors it is still niceto have a desk one, but if you are wondering which one to get; get aportable first (the cheapest one is $99), then you can take it toStarbucks, plug in your PI, keyboard and mouse, and headphones; andcompose some music with LMMS whilst pondering album art withGIMP.

Screen Projector

Don't forget about Projectors as those too are a kind of monitor (thecheap ones are $50 - $75). A projector turns any wall into a monitor.

Heist

She likley stole her daddy’s dad’s password by using her older brother’skey logger. To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command.ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connectionbetween two computers. She executes ssh alex@192.168.1.27 at 1:27. Andbegins using the ssh program.
The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her ownlocal shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in afull-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell promptchanges to that of the remote system. It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to[]~$[].
A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to typecommands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever wassupposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is usingfonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. Myprompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username isuser, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in iswarrior.
The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You canescalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where youcan read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar signwould then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be takenas you are in special privileges mode, often called root.

Warning

Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes ittalk using the say command.
A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is amanagement or administrative task, it is not really true programming, butit is OK to call it that.
The say command uses speech synthesis to convert text to speech. Thesay command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.She executes the command at 5:10
The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:
say -v serena dad watch out
You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing thesay command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library ofsounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.
How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serenais one of the voices? Nobody knows this at first, before a personexecutes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command iscalled man and people usually type man followed by the command-name thatthey want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up themanual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you canlist all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can domultiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internetversion of a man page for say: https://ss64.com/osx/say.html
People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,here is one example https://tldr.sh/ but it is always best to go tothe source, and just get used to the man command.
She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have justexecuted:
say dad watch out
And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostlyavailable on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.
espeak "dad watch out"
Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiplewords, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. Aprogrammer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeaksimply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assumethat whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unlesssomething starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereasespeak is very strict about input.

The Kill -9

At 3:49 the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting downher dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Macusers frequently use Sublime Text code editor. She issues the killcommand with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basicallycrashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to savedata. Here is the man page for the kill commandhttps://linux.die.net/man/1/kill. Unix programs that are activelyrunning are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)and each process has a number. The kill command can be used duringdevelopment and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is aboutto die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already badenough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, andthen in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save hisdata, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There isno handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process isdestroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. Sheexecutes kill -9 95251 at 5:26 his code editor disappears instantly.Yikes!

Jargon File

There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don’t worry. ESR is managing ajargon file you can read athttp://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html and he has a coolHOWTO on hackers from which I quote below:
What Is a Hacker?
There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers andnetworking wizards that traces its history back through decades to thefirst time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. Themembers of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built theInternet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackersmake the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you havecontributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you ahacker, you’re a hacker.
The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. Thereare people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronicsor music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any scienceor art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and maycall them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is reallyindependent of the particular medium the hacker works in.
There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, butaren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) whoget a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not verybright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you ahacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotiveengineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled intousing the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackersno end.
The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”

The Glider

Hacker Logo

This is a glider, a bit of a symbol for hackers, who are like cats, and donot like each other, herds, or stupid little symbols.

A look at a glider

Gliders

The glider comes from Conway’s Game of Life the little thingsmanufactured by Gospers glider gun and walking off towards lower rightare gliders in action.)

Game of Life and the Gliders

Cellular Automaton

Gliders, are of the world of Cellular Automaton, you have heard MurrayGell-Mann talk about it in context of Emergence the Game of Life is alittle simulation of playing with Fundamental Principles, and Accidents.Life emerged the same way the gliders do, out of Complexity, Infinity ofTime, Fundamental Principles, and Accidents (remember nobody counted thefailed attempts).

Stephen Wolfram

Here is Stephen Wolfram in his “Computing a theory of everything” TED talk,reminding us to never pause after uttering the words “I invented a newkind of science” - Oof!.
