    <h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">The $35 <span>Raspberry Pi<sup>[3]</sup></span> is the most handsome in a class of computers<br>called <span>Single-board computers<sup>[4]</sup></span>. They just released version 4, <strong>so make<br>sure you get that one</strong>; and don’t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the<br>PI, packaged in the <span>Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit<sup>[5]</sup></span>. Personally, I think<br>getting the original keyboard and mouse is really cool, I am not a fan of<br>the plastic case and would go for a cool looking <span>Heat Sink “Case”<sup>[6]</sup></span> -<br>and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two<br>part review of all the popular cases here you go: <span>Part 1<sup>[7]</sup></span> and <span>Part2<sup>[8]</sup></span>. Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd British<br>phrases.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There is a class of monitors called <span>Portable Monitors<sup>[11]</sup></span> it is still nice<br>to have a desk one, but if you are wondering which one to get; get a<br>portable first (the cheapest one is $99), then you can take it to<br>Starbucks, plug in your PI, keyboard and mouse, and headphones; and<br><span>compose some music<sup>[12]</sup></span> with <span>LMMS<sup>[13]</sup></span> whilst <span>pondering album art<sup>[14]</sup></span> with<br><span>GIMP<sup>[15]</sup></span>.</div>

    <h2>Heist</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">She likley stole her daddy’s dad’s password by using her older brother’s<br><span>key logger<sup>[17]</sup></span>. To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command.<br>ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection<br>between two computers. She executes ssh alex@192.168.1.27 at <span>1:27<sup>[18]</sup></span>. And<br>begins using the ssh program.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her own<br>local shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in a<br>full-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell prompt<br>changes to that of the remote system. It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to<br>[]~$[].</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type<br>commands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was<br>supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using<br>fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My<br>prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is<br>user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is<br>warrior.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can<br>escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you<br>can read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign<br>would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken<br>as you are in special privileges mode, often called <span>root<sup>[19]</sup></span>.</div>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it<br>talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a<br>management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but<br>it is OK to call it that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The say command uses <span>speech synthesis<sup>[20]</sup></span> to convert text to speech. The<br>say command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.<br>She executes the command at <span>5:10<sup>[21]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></div>
  <div class="paragraph">You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing the<br>say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of<br>sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena<br>is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person<br>executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is<br>called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that<br>they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the<br>manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can<br>list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do<br>multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet<br>version of a man page for say: <span>https://ss64.com/osx/say.html<sup>[22]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,<br>here is one example <span>https://tldr.sh/<sup>[23]</sup></span> but it is always best to go to<br>the source, and just get used to the man command.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just<br>executed:</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>say dad watch out</strong></div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly<br>available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>espeak "dad watch out"</strong></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple<br>words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A<br>programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak<br>simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”<br>whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume<br>that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless<br>something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas<br>espeak is very strict about input.</div>

    <h2>The Kill -9</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">At <span>3:49<sup>[24]</sup></span> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down<br>her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac<br>users frequently use <span>Sublime Text<sup>[25]</sup></span> code editor. She issues the kill<br>command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically<br>crashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save<br>data. Here is the man page for the kill command<br><span>https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill<sup>[26]</sup></span>. Unix programs that are actively<br>running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)<br>and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during<br>development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about<br>to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad<br>enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]<br>signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and<br>then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his<br>data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is<br>no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is<br>destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She<br>executes kill -9 95251 at <span>5:26<sup>[27]</sup></span> his code editor disappears instantly.<br><strong>Yikes!</strong></div>

  <header>
    <h2>Jargon File</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don’t worry. ESR is managing a<br>jargon file you can read at<br><span>http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html<sup>[30]</sup></span> and he has a cool<br><span>HOWTO<sup>[31]</sup></span> on hackers from which I quote below:</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>What Is a Hacker?</strong></div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and<br>networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the<br>first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The<br>members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the<br>Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers<br>make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have<br>contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a<br>hacker, you’re a hacker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There<br>are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics<br>or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science<br>or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may<br>call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really<br>independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but<br>aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who<br>get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.<br>Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.<br>Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very<br>bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a<br>hacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotive<br>engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into<br>using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers<br>no end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”</div>
