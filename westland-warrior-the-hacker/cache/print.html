    <h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">The $35 <span>Raspberry Pi<sup>[3]</sup></span> is the most handsome in a class of computers
    called <span>Single-board computers<sup>[4]</sup></span>. They just released version 4, <strong>so make
sure you get that one</strong>; and don’t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the
    PI, packaged in the <span>Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit<sup>[5]</sup></span>. Personally, I think
    getting the original keyboard and mouse is really cool, I am not a fan of
    the plastic case and would go for a cool looking <span>Heat Sink “Case”<sup>[6]</sup></span> -
    and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two
    part review of all the popular cases here you go: <span>Part 1<sup>[7]</sup></span> and <span>Part
2<sup>[8]</sup></span>. Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd British
    phrases.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">There is a class of monitors called <span>Portable Monitors<sup>[11]</sup></span> it is still nice
    to have a desk one, but if you are wondering which one to get; get a
    portable first (the cheapest one is $99), then you can take it to
    Starbucks, plug in your PI, keyboard and mouse, and headphones; and
    <span>compose some music<sup>[12]</sup></span> with <span>LMMS<sup>[13]</sup></span> whilst <span>pondering album art<sup>[14]</sup></span> with

    <h2>Heist</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">She likley stole her daddy’s dad’s password by using her older brother’s
    <span>key logger<sup>[17]</sup></span>. To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command.
    ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection
    between two computers. She executes ssh alex@192.168.1.27 at <span>1:27<sup>[18]</sup></span>. And
    begins using the ssh program.
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her own
    local shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in a
    full-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell prompt
    changes to that of the remote system. It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to
    []~$[].</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type
    commands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was
    supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using
    fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My
    prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is
    user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is
    warrior.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can
    escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you
    can read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign
    would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken
    as you are in special privileges mode, often called <span>root<sup>[19]</sup></span>.</div>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it
    talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a
    management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but
    it is OK to call it that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The say command uses <span>speech synthesis<sup>[20]</sup></span> to convert text to speech. The
    say command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.
    She executes the command at <span>5:10<sup>[21]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></div>
  <div class="paragraph">You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing the
    say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of
    sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena
    is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person
    executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is
    called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that
    they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the
    manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can
    list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do
    multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet
    version of a man page for say: <span>https://ss64.com/osx/say.html<sup>[22]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,
    here is one example <span>https://tldr.sh/<sup>[23]</sup></span> but it is always best to go to
    the source, and just get used to the man command.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just
    executed:</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>say dad watch out</strong></div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly
    available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>espeak "dad watch out"</strong></div>
  <div class="paragraph">Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple
    words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A
    programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak
    simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”
    whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume
    that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless
    something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas
    espeak is very strict about input.</div>

    <h2>The Kill -9</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">At <span>3:49<sup>[24]</sup></span> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down
    her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac
    users frequently use <span>Sublime Text<sup>[25]</sup></span> code editor. She issues the kill
    command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically
    crashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save
    data. Here is the man page for the kill command
    <span>https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill<sup>[26]</sup></span>. Unix programs that are actively
    running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)
    and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during
    development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about
    to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad
    enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]
    signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and
    then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his
    data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is
    no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is
    destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She
    executes kill -9 95251 at <span>5:26<sup>[27]</sup></span> his code editor disappears instantly.
    <strong>Yikes!</strong>

  <header>
    <h2>Jargon File</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don’t worry. ESR is managing a
    jargon file you can read at
    <span>http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html<sup>[30]</sup></span> and he has a cool
    <span>HOWTO<sup>[31]</sup></span> on hackers from which I quote below:
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph"><strong>What Is a Hacker?</strong></div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and
    networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the
    first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The
    members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the
    Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers
    make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have
    contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a
    hacker, you’re a hacker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There
    are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics
    or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science
    or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may
    call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really
    independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but
    aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who
    get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.
    Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.
    Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very
    bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a
    hacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotive
    engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into
    using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers
    no end.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”</div>
