To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command.<br>ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection<br>between two computers.

It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to<br>[]~$[].</p>\n  <p>A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type<br>commands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was<br>supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using<br>fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My<br>prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is<br>user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is<br>warrior.</p>\n  <p>The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can<br>escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you<br>can read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign<br>would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken<br>as you are in special privileges mode, often called <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/root.html\">root</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Warning</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it<br>talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</p>\n  <p>A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a<br>management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but<br>it is OK to call it that.</p>\n  <p>The say command uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis\">speech synthesis</a> to convert text to speech. The<br>say command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.<br>She executes the command at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310\">5:10</a></p>\n  <p>The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</p>\n  <p><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></p>\n  <p>You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing the<br>say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of<br>sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</p>\n  <p>How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena<br>is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person<br>executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is<br>called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that<br>they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the<br>manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can<br>list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do<br>multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet<br>version of a man page for say: <a href=\"https://ss64.com/osx/say.html\">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p>\n  <p>People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,<br>here is one example <a href=\"https://tldr.sh/\">https://tldr.sh/</a> but it is always best to go to<br>the source, and just get used to the man command.</p>\n  <p>She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just<br>executed:</p>\n  <p><strong>say dad watch out</strong></p>\n  <p>And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly<br>available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.</p>\n  <p><strong>espeak &quot;dad watch out&quot;</strong></p>\n  <p>Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple<br>words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A<br>programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak<br>simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”<br>whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume<br>that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless<br>something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas<br>espeak is very strict about input.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>The Kill -9</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>At <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229\">3:49</a> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down<br>her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac<br>users frequently use <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> code editor. She issues the kill<br>command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically<br>crashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save<br>data. Here is the man page for the kill command<br><a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill\">https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill</a>. Unix programs that are actively<br>running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)<br>and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during<br>development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about<br>to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad<br>enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]<br>signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and<br>then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his<br>data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is<br>no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is<br>destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She<br>executes kill -9 95251 at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=326\">5:26</a> his code editor disappears instantly.<br><strong>Yikes!</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>All Your Base Are Belong To Us</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/aybabtu.png\" alt=\"All Your Base Are Belong To Us\">\n  </figure>\n  <p>Lookup <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us.html\">All Your Base Are Belong To Us</a> over at the <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html\">Jargon File</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Jargon File</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don’t worry. ESR is managing a<br>jargon file you can read at<br><a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html</a> and he has a cool<br><a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html\">HOWTO</a> on hackers from which I quote below:</p>\n  <p><strong>What Is a Hacker?</strong></p>\n  <p>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and<br>networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the<br>first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The<br>members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the<br>Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers<br>make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have<br>contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a<br>hacker, you’re a hacker.</p>\n  <p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There<br>are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics<br>or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science<br>or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may<br>call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really<br>independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</p>\n  <p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but<br>aren&#39;t. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who<br>get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.<br>Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.<br>Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very<br>bright, and object that being able to break security doesn&#39;t make you a<br>hacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotive<br>engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into<br>using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers<br>no end.</p>\n  <p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>The Glider</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/glider.png\" alt=\"The Glider\">\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Hacker Logo</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>This is a glider, a bit of a symbol for hackers, who are like cats, and do<br>not like each other, herds, or stupid little symbols.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>A look at a glider</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/gliders2.gif\" alt=\"A look at a glider\">\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Gliders</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>The glider comes from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway’s Game of Life</a> the little things<br>manufactured by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(cellular_automaton)\">Gospers glider gun</a> and walking off towards lower right<br>are gliders in action.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Game of Life and the Gliders</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/gliders.gif\" alt=\"Game of Life and the Gliders\">\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Cellular Automaton</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>Gliders, are of the world of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\">Cellular Automaton</a>, you have heard Murray<br>Gell-Mann talk about it in context of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONiWmzrmfuY\">Emergence</a> the Game of Life is a<br>little simulation of playing with Fundamental Principles, and Accidents.<br>Life emerged the same way the gliders do, out of Complexity, Infinity of<br>Time, Fundamental Principles, and Accidents (remember nobody counted the<br>failed attempts).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Stephen Wolfram</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>Here is Stephen Wolfram in his “Computing a theory of everything” TED talk,<br>reminding us to <strong>never pause</strong> after uttering the words “I invented a new<br>kind of science” - Oof!.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Computing a theory of everything</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60P7717-XOQ\" class=\"no-tufte-underline\" title=\"Computing a theory of everything\">\n      <img src=\"/image/yid-60P7717-XOQ.jpg\" alt=\"Computing a theory of everything\">\n    </a>\n    <figcaption>Computing a theory of everything</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60P7717-XOQ\" title=\"Computing a theory of everything\">Play Video</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Pentesting Android Applications</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF3oi9Ra7IU\" class=\"no-tufte-underline\" title=\"Pentesting Android Applications\">\n      <img src=\"/image/yid-EF3oi9Ra7IU.jpg\" alt=\"Pentesting Android Applications\">\n    </a>\n    <figcaption>Pentesting Android Applications</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF3oi9Ra7IU\" title=\"Pentesting Android Applications\">Play Video</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Network Penetration Testing for Beginners</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE\" class=\"no-tufte-underline\" title=\"Network Penetration Testing for Beginners\">\n      <img src=\"/image/yid-3Kq1MIfTWCE.jpg\" alt=\"Network Penetration Testing for Beginners\">\n    </a>\n    <figcaption>Network Penetration Testing for Beginners</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE\" title=\"Network Penetration Testing for Beginners\">Play Video</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>White Hat Hackers</h2>\n  </header>\n  <p>Without Pentesters, Ethical Hacking, or White Hat Hackers we would never<br>become aware of vulnerabilities in our phones, smart homes, refrigerators,<br>lockers - day to day lives.

Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was<br>supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using<br>fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My<br>prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is<br>user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is<br>warrior.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can<br>escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you<br>can read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign<br>would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken<br>as you are in special privileges mode, often called <span>root<sup>[19]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Warning</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it<br>talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a<br>management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but<br>it is OK to call it that.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The say command uses <span>speech synthesis<sup>[20]</sup></span> to convert text to speech. The<br>say command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.<br>She executes the command at <span>5:10<sup>[21]</sup></span></div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing the<br>say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of<br>sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena<br>is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person<br>executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is<br>called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that<br>they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the<br>manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can<br>list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do<br>multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet<br>version of a man page for say: <span>https://ss64.com/osx/say.html<sup>[22]</sup></span></div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,<br>here is one example <span>https://tldr.sh/<sup>[23]</sup></span> but it is always best to go to<br>the source, and just get used to the man command.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just<br>executed:</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>say dad watch out</strong></div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly<br>available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>espeak \"dad watch out\"</strong></div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple<br>words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A<br>programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak<br>simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”<br>whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume<br>that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless<br>something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas<br>espeak is very strict about input.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>The Kill -9</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">At <span>3:49<sup>[24]</sup></span> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down<br>her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac<br>users frequently use <span>Sublime Text<sup>[25]</sup></span> code editor. She issues the kill<br>command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically<br>crashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save<br>data. Here is the man page for the kill command<br><span>https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill<sup>[26]</sup></span>. Unix programs that are actively<br>running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)<br>and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during<br>development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about<br>to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad<br>enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]<br>signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and<br>then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his<br>data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is<br>no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is<br>destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost.

The<br>members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the<br>Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers<br>make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have<br>contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a<br>hacker, you’re a hacker.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There<br>are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics<br>or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science<br>or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may<br>call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really<br>independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but<br>aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who<br>get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.<br>Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.<br>Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very<br>bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a<br>hacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotive<br>engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into<br>using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers<br>no end.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>The Glider</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/glider.png\" alt=\"The Glider\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Hacker Logo</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is a glider, a bit of a symbol for hackers, who are like cats, and do<br>not like each other, herds, or stupid little symbols.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>A look at a glider</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/gliders2.gif\" alt=\"A look at a glider\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Gliders</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The glider comes from <span>Conway’s Game of Life<sup>[32]</sup></span> the little things<br>manufactured by <span>Gospers glider gun<sup>[33]</sup></span> and walking off towards lower right<br>are gliders in action.)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Game of Life and the Gliders</h2>\n  </header>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/image/gliders.gif\" alt=\"Game of Life and the Gliders\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Cellular Automaton</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Gliders, are of the world of <span>Cellular Automaton<sup>[34]</sup></span>, you have heard Murray<br>Gell-Mann talk about it in context of <span>Emergence<sup>[35]</sup></span> the Game of Life is a<br>little simulation of playing with Fundamental Principles, and Accidents.<br>Life emerged the same way the gliders do, out of Complexity, Infinity of<br>Time, Fundamental Principles, and Accidents (remember nobody counted the<br>failed attempts).</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>Stephen Wolfram</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Here is Stephen Wolfram in his “Computing a theory of everything” TED talk,<br>reminding us to <strong>never pause</strong> after uttering the words “I invented a new<br>kind of science” - Oof!.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <span>Computing a theory of everything<sup>[36]</sup></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <span>Pentesting Android Applications<sup>[37]</sup></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section yt avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <span>Network Penetration Testing for Beginners<sup>[38]</sup></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <header>\n    <h2>White Hat Hackers</h2>\n  </header>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Without Pentesters, Ethical Hacking, or White Hat Hackers we would never<br>become aware of vulnerabilities in our phones, smart homes, refrigerators,<br>lockers - day to day lives.

  "text": "What is a Hacker? with Emmanuel Goldstein.[1]\nKids hack their Dad's computer on her Raspberry Pi[2]\n\nRASPBERRY PI\n\nThe $35 Raspberry Pi[3] is the most handsome in a class of computers\ncalled Single-board computers[4]. They just released version 4, so make\nsure you get that one; and don’t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the\nPI, packaged in the Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit[5]. Personally, I think\ngetting the original keyboard and mouse is really cool, I am not a fan of\nthe plastic case and would go for a cool looking Heat Sink “Case”[6] -\nand then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two\npart review of all the popular cases here you go: Part 1[7] and Part2[8]. Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd British\nphrases.\nRaspberry Pi 4[9]\nWhat's inside the Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit?[10]\n\nPORTABLE MONITOR\n\nMONITORS\n\nThere is a class of monitors called Portable Monitors[11] it is still nice\nto have a desk one, but if you are wondering which one to get; get a\nportable first (the cheapest one is $99), then you can take it to\nStarbucks, plug in your PI, keyboard and mouse, and headphones; and\ncompose some music[12] with LMMS[13] whilst pondering album art[14] with\nGIMP[15].\n\nSCREEN PROJECTOR\n\nDon't forget about Projectors[16] as those too are a kind of monitor (the\ncheap ones are $50 - $75). A projector turns any wall into a monitor.\n\nHEIST\n\nShe likley stole her daddy’s dad’s password by using her older brother’s\nkey logger[17]. To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command.\nssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection\nbetween two computers. She executes ssh alex@192.168.1.27 at 1:27[18]. And\nbegins using the ssh program.\nThe remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her own\nlocal shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in a\nfull-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell prompt\nchanges to that of the remote system. It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to\n[]~$[].\nA shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type\ncommands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was\nsupposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using\nfonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My\nprompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is\nuser, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is\nwarrior.\nThe dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can\nescalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you\ncan read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign\nwould then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken\nas you are in special privileges mode, often called root[19].\n\nWARNING\n\nNow, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it\ntalk using the say command.\nA command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a\nmanagement or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but\nit is OK to call it that.\nThe say command uses speech synthesis[20] to convert text to speech. The\nsay command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.\nShe executes the command at 5:10[21]\nThe command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:\nsay -v serena dad watch out\nYou see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing the\nsay command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of\nsounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.\nHow do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena\nis one of the voices? Nobody knows this at first, before a person\nexecutes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is\ncalled man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that\nthey want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the\nmanual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can\nlist all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do\nmultiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet\nversion of a man page for say: https://ss64.com/osx/say.html[22]\nPeople are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,\nhere is one example https://tldr.sh/[23] but it is always best to go to\nthe source, and just get used to the man command.\nShe didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just\nexecuted:\nsay dad watch out\nAnd the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly\navailable on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.\nespeak \"dad watch out\"\nEspeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple\nwords, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A\nprogrammer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak\nsimply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”\nwhereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume\nthat whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless\nsomething starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas\nespeak is very strict about input.\n\nTHE KILL -9\n\nAt 3:49[24] the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down\nher dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac\nusers frequently use Sublime Text[25] code editor. She issues the kill\ncommand with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically\ncrashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save\ndata. Here is the man page for the kill command\nhttps://linux.die.net/man/1/kill[26]. Unix programs that are actively\nrunning are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)\nand each process has a number. The kill command can be used during\ndevelopment and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about\nto die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad\nenough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]\nsignal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and\nthen in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his\ndata, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is\nno handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is\ndestroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She\nexecutes kill -9 95251 at 5:26[27] his code editor disappears instantly.\nYikes!\n\nALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US\n\nLookup All Your Base Are Belong To Us[28] over at the Jargon File[29]\n\nJARGON FILE\n\nThere is a wee bit of jargon here, but don’t worry. ESR is managing a\njargon file you can read at\nhttp://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html[30] and he has a cool\nHOWTO[31] on hackers from which I quote below:\nWhat Is a Hacker?\nThere is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and\nnetworking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the\nfirst time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments.

Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into\nusing the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers\nno end.\nThe basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”\n\nTHE GLIDER\n\nHACKER LOGO\n\nThis is a glider, a bit of a symbol for hackers, who are like cats, and do\nnot like each other, herds, or stupid little symbols.\n\nA LOOK AT A GLIDER\n\nGLIDERS\n\nThe glider comes from Conway’s Game of Life[32] the little things\nmanufactured by Gospers glider gun[33] and walking off towards lower right\nare gliders in action.)\n\nGAME OF LIFE AND THE GLIDERS\n\nCELLULAR AUTOMATON\n\nGliders, are of the world of Cellular Automaton[34], you have heard Murray\nGell-Mann talk about it in context of Emergence[35] the Game of Life is a\nlittle simulation of playing with Fundamental Principles, and Accidents.\nLife emerged the same way the gliders do, out of Complexity, Infinity of\nTime, Fundamental Principles, and Accidents (remember nobody counted the\nfailed attempts).\n\nSTEPHEN WOLFRAM\n\nHere is Stephen Wolfram in his “Computing a theory of everything” TED talk,\nreminding us to never pause after uttering the words “I invented a new\nkind of science” - Oof!.\nComputing a theory of everything[36]\nPentesting Android Applications[37]\nNetwork Penetration Testing for Beginners[38]\n\nWHITE HAT HACKERS\n\nWithout Pentesters, Ethical Hacking, or White Hat Hackers we would never\nbecome aware of vulnerabilities in our phones, smart homes, refrigerators,\nlockers - day to day lives. They do not keep information secret, and help\nus keep our family, homes, and possessions safer and more secure.\nSmarter Every Day on Vulnerabilities in Smart Devices[39]\n\nLOCK PICKING LAWYER\n\nLock Picking Lawyer[40] has 1.14M subscribers (Dec, 2019).\nMy Wife vs. Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream Lock[41]\nFortress Combination Padlock Decoded FAST and Bypassed[42]\nGallium vs. Titalium - Abus Padlock Meets a Gruesome End[43]\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vjMnUX6v4M\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W76o_iG7Y7g\n[3]: https://www.raspberrypi.org/\n[4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rcNjgVgc-I\n[6]: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD568FB/ref=twister_B07VD58LGV?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTlB6oju5w\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYb2IEsfhnE\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sajBySPeYH0\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88WOo4DIElY\n[11]: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=+Portable+Monitors\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfa9hGJzoY\n[13]: https://lmms.io/\n[14]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mgrY-U9_8E\n[15]: https://www.gimp.org/\n[16]: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=projectors\n[17]: https://www.amazon.com/keylogger/s?k=keylogger\n[18]: https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=87\n[19]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/root.html\n[20]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis\n[21]: https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310\n[22]: https://ss64.com/osx/say.html\n[23]: https://tldr.sh/\n[24]: https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229\n[25]: https://www.sublimetext.com/\n[26]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill\n[27]: https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=326\n[28]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us.html\n[29]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html\n[30]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html\n[31]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html\n[32]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\n[33]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(cellular_automaton)\n[34]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\n[35]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONiWmzrmfuY\n[36]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60P7717-XOQ\n[37]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF3oi9Ra7IU\n[38]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE\n[39]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozIKwGt38LQ\n[40]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm9K6rby98W8JigLoZOh6FQ/search?query=combination\n[41]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lod_LUp3ggc\n[42]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fah-LJJaPWg\n[43]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeghGhVdt9s",
