    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">The widespread urban legend that one swallows a high number of spiders
    during sleep in one's life has no basis in reality. A sleeping person
    causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by breathing, the beating heart,
    snoring etc. all of which warn spiders of danger.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or

    economics.</div>

    <h2>False Memory</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Article adjustment on eyewitness report. Loftus' meta-analysis on language
    manipulation studies suggested the phenomenon effects taking hold on the
    recall process and products of the human memory. Even the smallest
    adjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposed
    memory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone if
    they'd seen "the" stop sign, rather than "a" stop sign, provided the
    respondent with a presupposition that there was a stop sign in the scene.
    This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they had
    indeed seen the stop sign.</div>

    <h2>False Etymologies of English Words</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">The actual origin of the phrase "the whole nine yards" is a mystery, and
    nearly all claimed explanations are easily proven false. Incorrect
    explanations include the length of machine gun belts, the capacity of
    concrete mixers (in cubic yards), various types of fabric, and many other
    explanations. All are probably false, since most rely on nine yards when
    evidence suggests that the phrase began as "the whole six yards". In
    addition, the phrase has appeared in print as early as 1907, while many
    explanations require a much later origin date.</div>

    <h2>English Usage Misconceptions</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="paragraph">Misconception: The words "and" and "but" must not begin a sentence. Those
    who impose this rule on themselves are following a modern English "rule"
    that was not used historically. Jeremy Butterfield described this perceived
    prohibition as one of "the folk commandments of English usage". The Chicago
    Manual of Style says: There is a widespread belief—one with no historical
    or grammatical foundation—that it is an error to begin a sentence with a
    conjunction such as 'and', 'but', or 'so'. In fact, a substantial
    percentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the sentences in first-rate
    writing begin with conjunctions. It has been so for centuries, and even the
    most conservative grammarians have followed this practice.</div>
