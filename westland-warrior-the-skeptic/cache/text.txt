False Memory

Article adjustment on eyewitness report. Loftus' meta-analysis on languagemanipulation studies suggested the phenomenon effects taking hold on therecall process and products of the human memory. Even the smallestadjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposedmemory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone ifthey'd seen "the" stop sign, rather than "a" stop sign, provided therespondent with a presupposition that there was a stop sign in the scene.This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they hadindeed seen the stop sign.

False Etymologies of English Words

The actual origin of the phrase "the whole nine yards" is a mystery, andnearly all claimed explanations are easily proven false. Incorrectexplanations include the length of machine gun belts, the capacity ofconcrete mixers (in cubic yards), various types of fabric, and many otherexplanations. All are probably false, since most rely on nine yards whenevidence suggests that the phrase began as "the whole six yards". Inaddition, the phrase has appeared in print as early as 1907, while manyexplanations require a much later origin date.

English Usage Misconceptions

Misconception: The words "and" and "but" must not begin a sentence. Thosewho impose this rule on themselves are following a modern English "rule"that was not used historically. Jeremy Butterfield described this perceivedprohibition as one of "the folk commandments of English usage". The ChicagoManual of Style says: There is a widespread belief—one with no historicalor grammatical foundation—that it is an error to begin a sentence with aconjunction such as 'and', 'but', or 'so'. In fact, a substantialpercentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the sentences in first-ratewriting begin with conjunctions. It has been so for centuries, and even themost conservative grammarians have followed this practice.
