Common Misconceptions
---------------------

The widespread urban legend that one swallows a high number of spiders  
during sleep in one's life has no basis in reality. A sleeping person  
causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by breathing, the beating heart,  
snoring etc. all of which warn spiders of danger.

Cognitive Biases
----------------

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or  
rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral  
economics.

False Memory
------------

Article adjustment on eyewitness report. Loftus' meta-analysis on language  
manipulation studies suggested the phenomenon effects taking hold on the  
recall process and products of the human memory. Even the smallest  
adjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposed  
memory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone if  
they'd seen "the" stop sign, rather than "a" stop sign, provided the  
respondent with a presupposition that there was a stop sign in the scene.  
This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they had  
indeed seen the stop sign.

False Etymologies of English Words
----------------------------------

The actual origin of the phrase "the whole nine yards" is a mystery, and  
nearly all claimed explanations are easily proven false. Incorrect  
explanations include the length of machine gun belts, the capacity of  
concrete mixers (in cubic yards), various types of fabric, and many other  
explanations. All are probably false, since most rely on nine yards when  
evidence suggests that the phrase began as "the whole six yards". In  
addition, the phrase has appeared in print as early as 1907, while many  
explanations require a much later origin date.

English Usage Misconceptions
----------------------------

Misconception: The words "and" and "but" must not begin a sentence. Those  
who impose this rule on themselves are following a modern English "rule"  
that was not used historically. Jeremy Butterfield described this perceived  
prohibition as one of "the folk commandments of English usage". The Chicago  
Manual of Style says: There is a widespread belief—one with no historical  
or grammatical foundation—that it is an error to begin a sentence with a  
conjunction such as 'and', 'but', or 'so'. In fact, a substantial  
percentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the sentences in first-rate  
writing begin with conjunctions. It has been so for centuries, and even the  
most conservative grammarians have followed this practice.
