    Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop,
    and often block traffic.

    If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want
    to do their job, go home, and get paid.

    If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw
    you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job
    and go watch some TV.

    You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they'll just tag you as "Gifted"
    and you'll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you'll struggle to remember where
    it all started and what the battle was for.

  title: Because The Battle Is Not For You
  text: |-
    The battle is for those that come; after you.

    In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the
    end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the
    same.

    In long term, you help the world grow, it won't be your world, it will be
    the world of the future.

    The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education
    are two separate things.

    It will make you tired.

    There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you
    realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too
    low.

    Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education,
    the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some "good"
    grades, making your parents happy.

    Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up
    excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never
    looking back.

    Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue.

  text: |-
    I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only
    the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to
    teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

    I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish
    to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.

    I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so
    sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a
    broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to
    its lowest terms...

    Real Education, is not about getting really educated.

    It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health.

    Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is
    not a healthy life.

  text: |-
    The first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility.

    No one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or
    vacation, or else.

    You are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you
    are to rage, to rage against the dying of the light.
