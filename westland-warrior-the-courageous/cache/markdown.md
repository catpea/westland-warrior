English political leader, activist, writer and feminist icon. Known as a  
campaigner for women's suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until  
1919 she led Britain's largest women's rights organisation, the National  
Union of Women's Suffrage Societies.

The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop,  
and often block traffic.

If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want  
to do their job, go home, and get paid.

If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw  
you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job  
and go watch some TV.

You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they'll just tag you as "Gifted"  
and you'll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you'll struggle to remember where  
it all started and what the battle was for.

Because The Battle Is Not For You
---------------------------------

The battle is for those that come; after you.

In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the  
end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the  
same.

In long term, you help the world grow, it won't be your world, it will be  
the world of the future.

The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education  
are two separate things.

It will make you tired.

How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood.

Bad News
--------

There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you  
realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too  
low.

Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education,  
the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some "good"  
grades, making your parents happy.

Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up  
excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never  
looking back.

Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue.

Quote by Henry David Thoreau
----------------------------

> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only  
> the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to  
> teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
> 
> I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish  
> to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.
> 
> I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so  
> sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a  
> broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to  
> its lowest terms...
> 
> \-- Henry David Thoreau - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry\_David\_Thoreau

The Good News
-------------

Real Education, is not about getting really educated.

It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health.

Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is  
not a healthy life.

Article One: Inherent Dignity, Nobility.
----------------------------------------

The first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility.

No one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or  
vacation, or else.

You are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you  
are to rage, to rage against the dying of the light.
