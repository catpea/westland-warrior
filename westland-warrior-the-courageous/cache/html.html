    <h2>The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop,<br>and often block traffic.</p>
  <p>If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want<br>to do their job, go home, and get paid.</p>
  <p>If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw<br>you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job<br>and go watch some TV.</p>
  <p>You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&#39;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot;<br>and you&#39;ll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you&#39;ll struggle to remember where<br>it all started and what the battle was for.</p>

    <h2>Because The Battle Is Not For You</h2>
  </header>
  <p>The battle is for those that come; after you.</p>
  <p>In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the<br>end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the<br>same.</p>
  <p>In long term, you help the world grow, it won&#39;t be your world, it will be<br>the world of the future.</p>
  <p>The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education<br>are two separate things.</p>
  <p>It will make you tired.</p>

    <h2>Bad News</h2>
  </header>
  <p>There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you<br>realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too<br>low.</p>
  <p>Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education,<br>the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot;<br>grades, making your parents happy.</p>
  <p>Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up<br>excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never<br>looking back.</p>
  <p>Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue.</p>

    <h2>Quote by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
  </header>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only<br>the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to<br>teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>
    <p>I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish<br>to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>
    <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so<br>sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a<br>broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to<br>its lowest terms...</p>

  <p>Real Education, is not about getting really educated.</p>
