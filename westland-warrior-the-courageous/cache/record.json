  "text": "DAME MILLICENT GARRETT FAWCETT\n\nEnglish political leader, activist, writer and feminist icon. Known as a\ncampaigner for women's suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until\n1919 she led Britain's largest women's rights organisation, the National\nUnion of Women's Suffrage Societies.\n\nTHE ROAD BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE FUTURE IS LONG, BUT IT CONTINUES UNBROKEN.\n\nRelative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop,\nand often block traffic.\nIf you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want\nto do their job, go home, and get paid.\nIf you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw\nyou out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job\nand go watch some TV.\nYou can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they'll just tag you as \"Gifted\"\nand you'll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you'll struggle to remember where\nit all started and what the battle was for.\n\nBECAUSE THE BATTLE IS NOT FOR YOU\n\nThe battle is for those that come; after you.\nIn short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the\nend all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the\nsame.\nIn long term, you help the world grow, it won't be your world, it will be\nthe world of the future.\nThe battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education\nare two separate things.\nIt will make you tired.\nHow dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood.[1]\n\nBAD NEWS\n\nThere are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you\nrealize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too\nlow.\nNothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education,\nthe broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some \"good\"\ngrades, making your parents happy.\nNothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up\nexcuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never\nlooking back.\nAlas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue.\n\nQUOTE BY HENRY DAVID THOREAU\n\n> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only\n> the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to\n> teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\n> \n> I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish\n> to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.\n> \n> I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so\n> sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a\n> broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to\n> its lowest terms...\n> \n> Henry David Thoreau[2]\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS\n\nReal Education, is not about getting really educated.\nIt is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health.\nLife that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is\nnot a healthy life.\nFaith of the Heart[3]\n\nARTICLE ONE: INHERENT DIGNITY, NOBILITY.\n\nThe first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility.\nNo one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or\nvacation, or else.\nYou are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you\nare to rage, to rage against the dying of the light.\n\nSELF EDUCATION STARTS WITH LIFE CHANGING BOOKS\n\nBest way to understand a book, is to listen to the Author reading it. And\nthe best way to listen to a book, is while climbing a great mountain[4].\n\nA SHORT HISTORY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING\n\nYouTube[5] · Wikipedia[6] · Audible[7]\n\nTHE DEMON-HAUNTED WORLD: SCIENCE AS A CANDLE IN THE DARK\n\nYouTube[8] · Wikipedia[9] · Audible[10]\n\nDEATH BY BLACK HOLE: AND OTHER COSMIC QUANDARIES\n\nYouTube[11] · Wikipedia[12] · Audible[13]\n\nWHAT IF?: SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS TO ABSURD HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS\n\nYouTube[14] · Wikipedia[15] · Audible[16]\n\nTHE PHYSICS OF SUPERHEROES\n\nYouTube[17] · Wikipedia[18] · Audible[19]\n\nMIND MAPPING\n\nThe best tool to refine your vision is Mind Mapping[20].
